Thank you for your interest in contributing to documentation for the Substrate development framework.
As a member of the community, you are invited and encouraged to contribute by submitting issues, offering
suggestions for improvements to existing content, adding review comments to existing pull requests, proposing
new content, or creating new pull requests to fix issues or provide new content.

We value, respect, and appreciate all contributions from the developer community and only ask that you
agree to abide by our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and review our [Contributor guidelines](#contributor-guidelines).

To learn more about how to contribute, including guidelines for how to structure content and how to participate in our
bounty program that pays you for contributing, see the following topics:

## Repository working guidelines

To facilitate a streamlined and pleasant workflow for contributors and maintainers, we follow some
particular workflows and best practices in this repository.

#### Creating PRs

**Always create your own branch to work on the site, and submit pull requests to `develop`.**

All contributions should target `develop` for pushing new content before merging with `main` and
publishing the site. The `main` branch is production ONLY and must be deployed by a maintainer
with the access to do so through Forestry.

The maintainers ask everyone to be responsible about **rebasing**
([not merging](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)) on top of the present
`develop` branch just before merging and carefully reviewing any conflicts here - especially
whenever you are changing globally used config/gatsby files. Any changes in the same pages we make
in different PRs without this can conflict otherwise!

Before maintainers merge a PR, they will:

- Get required approvals from other maintainers
- Clone repo locally
- Checkout and pull local `develop` up to the head of `origin/develop`
- Checkout the PR branch from `origin/<pr branch>`
- `git rebase develop`
- Review and fix conflicts correctly, especially with respect to links/config files
- `git push --force` (for the **PR branch**, \_not `develop`! )
- If some major change was needed in this, get approvals/clarifications on these.
- `git merge --squash` the PR (on the github PR's page)

## Contributor guidelines

The most valuable contributions from the community typically take the form of how-to guides or
tutorials that help other developers solve specific problems, learn specific skills, or demonstrate
specific tasks.

If you would like to contribute, you might be wondering “What is the difference between a ‘how-to’
guide and a tutorial?”.

### How-to guides

A how-to guide describes how to achieve a goal or complete a task. Only the information that is
pertinent to achieving that goal or completing the task is included. With how-to guides, readers
have enough information to know what they want to do—for example, open a bank account—but not
necessarily enough information to know how to do it—for example, 1) select an institution, 2) fill
out an application, 3) deposit a minimum amount of currency. How-to guides often include links to
additional information, but should not include explanations that take the focus away from what the
reader wants to accomplish.

### Tutorials

A tutorial is a hands-on illustration or lesson that enables the reader to achieve a
highly-predictable result. Tutorials assume that readers have no prior knowledge on the subject
being covered and that they require explicit guidance to complete each step to reach a well-known
outcome. Typically, a tutorial is a guided tour that helps the reader complete one organic task from
start to finish. There are no detours and the information should not be broken out into subtopics
because the steps must be completed in order, not in a sequence of the reader’s choosing.

The single most important aspect of a tutorial is that it should always result in a successful,
expected outcome. The successful outcome is what inspires confidence and delight in the reader. The
single most important distinction between a how-to guide and a tutorial is that in a tutorial the
author decides what the goal should be and the author eliminates all distractions that would detract
from the successful achievement of the goal.

### Recommendations for writing how-to guides

The Substrate Developer Hub is intended to provide a modular and extensible framework of resources
for the Substrate developer community and broader ecosystem. To achieve this goal, we want to make
it easy for contributors to integrate new content that follows a few guiding principles and basic
conventions for structure and style. As a content creator, you should keep the following general
principles in mind:

- ◼️ Modularity. Each guide has a well-defined and useful focus. However, if there’s information
  that’s useful in more than one guide, you can abstract it into a standalone topic and reuse it in
  multiple places.

- 🔗 Linking. Guides should use links where they are useful—for example, to guide readers to
  concepts or reference topics—but be mindful that stale links frustrate readers.

- ⏯️ Examples. Useful code examples are a critical component of creating a useful guide.

- 🛰️ Related references. Guides can include links to related resources, like Rust docs, video
  content, or other guides and tutorials.

### Content categories and tags

The How-to guides are grouped into categories to help keep them organized in the how-to-guides repository. The current groupings
reflect the different areas of development within Substrate:

- Basics. Where the really simple guides live, those that can be referenced by more complex ones.

- Pallet design. Everything to do with building custom pallets with or without FRAME.

- Weights. Any content that covers configuring weights for specific use cases.

- Testing. A collection of guides for testing.

- Storage migrations. Anything to do with storage migrations.

- Consensus. Client stuff, bridging, node configurations.

* Parachains. Guides related to building parachain capabilities.

The source files use tags to identify the categories that apply. As a content contributor, you
should use tags to identify the level of complexity and the most appropriate category for your
content.

#### Complexity

Specify the level of complexity by adding the most appropriate tag from the following list:

- beginner
- intermediate
- advanced

#### Information category

Specify the category for your article by adding the most appropriate tag from the following list:

- basics
- client
- consensus
- currency
- fees
- frame-v1
- migration
- node
- pallet design
- proof-of-work
- runtime
- storage
- testing
- weights
- parachains
- contracts
