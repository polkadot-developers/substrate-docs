The final part of the workshop will step you through how to use the <ExternalLink
url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch"> polkadot-launch </ExternalLink> tool to
_rapidly_ launch a full parachain testnet with multiple parachains and a common relaychain.

> Note that it is still recommended to understand [the manual process](../pt1), as this script is
> not a perfect fit for all use cases, and when things go wrong, you know how to troubleshoot.

## Learning outcomes

- Use `polkadot-launch` to launch a parachain environment

## How `polkadot-launch` works

At a high level, this tool **automates** the steps you learned previously to spin up multiple relay
chain nodes and parachain nodes in a single local machine. It also leverages on Polkadot-JS API to connect to
these spawned nodes over their WebSocket endpoints and make a few calls to the nodes on your network
to configure as you specify.

## Installation

### Option A: Global install

For most cases, you do not need to edit `polkadot-launch`. Run the following command to install the
script globally in your environment:

```bash
yarn global add polkadot-launch
# Check install:
polkadot-launch --version
# 1.7.0
```

### Option B: Clone & run locally

If you find you need to edit the script, or otherwise would like to build this yourself, do:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paritytech/polkadot-launch.git
cd polkadot-launch
# You need node v14+ -- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-update-node-js-and-npm-to-next-version/
yarn install
# The entry point is `cl.js`
node dist/cli.js --version
# 1.7.0
```

## `polkadot-launch` overview

1. Build your relay chain (with the runtimes you want enabled) and any parachains **with matching**
   **versions(!!)** cloned and compiled. Generate or acquire the proper chainspecs, genesis files,
   and runtime Wasm blobs for your chains ([instructions here](../pt1)). You will need all these
   files and binaries to use your configuration moving forward.

2. Write a config file for `polkadot-launch` to fit your needs.

3. Launch and do initial registration tasks automatically with `polkadot-launch`

The important new aspect here is the config file. Here is one to get started:

- <a
    href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/polkadot-launch-config/relay-3-validators--2paras-1collator.json"
    download
  >
    relay-3-validators--2paras-1collator.json
  </a>

Let's take a brief look inside the file. Inside the `relaychain` section, there are:

- `bin`: where the relay chain binary is located.
- `chain`: the type of the relay chain we are launching.
- `nodes`: number of nodes we have and their respective config. As mentioned, 3 nodes will be
  deployed using the well-known addresses as session keys. We also specify their respective
  websocket port (`wsPort`) and TCP port (`port`) they listen to.

Inside the `parachains` section, **two parachains** are defined, each with:

- `bin`: where the parachain binary is located.
- `id`: the para ID of each chain.
- `balance`: initial balance to be set for the well-known accounts.
- `nodes`: the node setting for the corresponding parachains.

Each parachain has one node setup.

3. Update the `bin` location for the relaychain and parachains to an absolute path where your
   binaries are located. For the two parachains, use the same Parachain Template binary.

## Launch a network

Now you can start your network with the next commands:

```bash
mkdir polkadot-config
cd polkadot-config
# download the `relay-3-validators--2paras-1collator.json` file into this directory.
polkadot-launch relay-3-validators--2paras-1collator.json
```

If everything goes well, you should see messages similar to the following:

![polkadot-launch-log.png](../../../../src/images/tutorials/09-cumulus/polkadot-launch-log.png)

Now in your current working directory you will find the relay chain node logs are written to
`alice.log`, `bob.log`, and `charlie.log` for your three validators. While the parachain logs are
indicated with the websocket port numbers they are listening to, `9988.log`and `9999.log`. There
are also customized chain spec files used to launch the networks.

If you wish to monitor the logs in real time, you can do so with:

```bash
# While `polkadot-launch` is running...
# Open a new terminal for each node and monitor logs with:
tail -f <logfile>
```

Another way to verify the setup is correct is by going to:

<ExternalLink url="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains">
  Polkadot-JS Apps > Network > Parachains
</ExternalLink>

After configure the Apps to connect to the local **relay chain node**, you should see the UI
showing two parachains being connected to the relay chain.

  type={`green`}
  title={`Congratulation`}
  text={`You have automated the launch of a 3-node relay chain, and two parachains with a
single node using \`polkadot-launch\` CLI utility.`}
/>

Next, we will go through in details the configuration parameters that `polkadot-launch` recognizes
in the config file.

## `polkadot-launch` configuration files

The config file can broadly divided into five sections as shown below.

```json
{
  "relaychain": {
    //...
  },
  "parachains": [
    {
      //...
    },
    {
      //...
    }
  ],
  "simpleParachains": [
    {
      //...
    },
    {
      //...
    }
  ],
  "hrmpChannels": [
    {
      //...
    }
  ],
  "types": {},
  "finalization": false
}
```

### `relaychain` section

This section of JSON specifies how the relaychain should be launched. The full config looks like
the following:

```json
"relaychain": {
  "bin": "./bin/polkadot",
  "chain": "rococo-local",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "alice",
      "wsPort": 9944,
      "port": 30444,
      "basePath": "/tmp/alice",
      "flags": ""
    },
    {
      //...
    }
  ],
  "genesis": {
    "runtime": {
      "runtime_genesis_config": {
        "parachainsConfiguration": {
          "config": {
            "validation_upgrade_frequency": 1,
            "validation_upgrade_delay": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `bin`: where the relay chain binary is located.
- `chain`: the type of the chain to be launched. The full list of supported types is
  [specified here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/cli/src/command.rs#L94-L135).
  Typically we want to use `rococo-local` for testing and development.

For each node inside `nodes`, the following properties can be added:

- `name`: one of well-known account names, e.g. `alice`, `bob`, `charlie`, or `dave`.
- `wsPort`: the websocket port this node listens to.
- `port`: the TCP port this node listens to.
- `basePath`: location of where the chain database is going to be saved. If unspecified, the node
  is launched with `--tmp` flag.
- `flags`: any addition flags that would be passed to the node.

Finally, there is `genesis` property. It is a JSON object with properties you want to modify from
the default genesis configuration. Regarding the `genesis` value, it is the same as all the values
shown in the chain spec when generated by the following command:

```bash
./polkadot build-spec --chain=rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode
```

### `parachains` section

`parachains` is an array of objects, configuring how one or more parachains are to be launched. It
looks like the following:

```json
"parachains": [
  {
    "bin": "./bin/parachain-collator",
    "id": "2000",
    "balance": "1000000000000000000000",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "wsPort": 9988,
        "port": 31200,
        "name": "alice",
        "flags": ["--", "--execution=wasm"]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    // ...
  }
]
```

- `bin`: where the parachain collator binary is located.
- `id`: the para ID assigned to this parachain. Must be unique among the network.
- `balance`: (optional) configure a starting amount of balance on the relay chain for this chain's
  account ID.
- For each node in `nodes`, it has the same configuration as node config in the relay chain.

### `simpleParachains` section

This is similar to parachains but for "simple" collators like

<ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/parachain/test-parachains/adder/collator">
  adder-collator
</ExternalLink>
, a simple collator that lives in the polkadot repo for testing. It supports a subset of configuration
values, and is meant to run with a single node only.

```json
"simpleParachains": [
  {
    "bin": "./bin/adder-collator",
    "id": "400",
    "balance": "1000000000000000000000",
    "port": "31400",
    "name": "alice"
  }
]
```

Their meanings are similar to their counterparts in [`parachains` section](). Note that since
a simple parachain only has one node, configs that was originally in `nodes` property are flattened
into one level now.

### `hrmpChannels` section

This section config how the Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP) channels are open
between the specified parachain pair so they can send messages to each others. Keep in mind that
an HRMP channel is unidirectional and you need to open channels in both directions to enable them
communicating both ways.

`hrmpChannels` property is defined as follows.

```json
"hrmpChannels": [
  {
    "sender": 2000,
    "recipient": 3000,
    "maxCapacity": 8,
    "maxMessageSize": 512
  }
]
```

- `sender`: chain para ID messages are sent from.
- `recipient`: chain para ID messages are sent to.
- `maxCapacity`: number of messages that can be sent before they are acknowledged by
  the recipient chain.
- `maxMessageSize`: maximum size of a message that can be sent across.

### Remaining configurable items

Finally, we have `types`, and `finalization`.

- `types`: [custom Substrate types](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend/) to be fed
  into Polkadot-JS API.
- `finalization`: either `true` or `false`, whether you want transactions submitted to the network
  to wait for finalization.

## Next steps

Now we have the ability to configure complex networks to thoroughly test locally. But what about transitioning
to a production system? How do you connect to a relay chain that exists already and get a parachain
slot there? In the [next section](../pt4) we learn about how to connect to Rococo.
