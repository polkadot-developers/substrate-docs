## Launching a parachain

### Reserve a para ID

To connect to any relay chain, you must first reserve a para ID for your parachain. It is called
"para ID", because the same ID can be seen as its parachain ID or parathread ID, depending on your
current relay chain slot state. To reserve one, you need to have sufficient amount of the currency
on the network to reserve the ID. Check for the amount on your target relay chain.

The relay chain is responsible for allotting all para IDs and will be simply incrementing starting
at `2000` for all chains connecting that are not
[common good parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-common-goods). These chains use
a different method to allocate para IDs.

In this exercise, we will reserve a para ID using
[Polkadot-JS Apps connecting to your local relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/parachains/parathreads).
Under the **Network** > **Parachains** sub-page, click on **Parathreads** tab and use the
**+ ParaId** button.

  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`You will need to connect to a relay chain to submit this extrinsic! In testnets, your Parachain
    ID will be 2000 for your first parathread reservation.`}
/>

Note that the account used to reserve the para ID must also be the origin for using this
para ID. Once you submit this extrinsic successfully (you must see a successful `registrar.Reserved`
event with your `paraID`), you can now launch your parachain or parathread using this reserved ID.

### Specify a parachain for the relay chain

We'll begin by generating a few files based on the Parachain Template with the reserved para ID
(para ID `2000`).

#### Generate a parachain genesis state

To register a parachain, the relay chain needs to know the parachain's
[genesis state](/v3/runtime/chain-specs#the-genesis-state). The collator node can export that state
to a file. Go to your Parachain Template folder, the following command will create a file
containing the parachain's entire genesis state, hex-encoded:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-state --parachain-id 2000 > para-2000-genesis
```

#### Obtain Wasm runtime validation function

The relay chain also needs the parachain-specific runtime validation logic to validate
parachain blocks. The parachain collator node also has a command to produce this Wasm blob:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-wasm > para-2000-wasm
```

The Wasm blob does not depend on the para ID, so we are not providing that flag. If you are
launching multiple parachains using the exact same runtime, you do not need to regenerate the Wasm
blob each time.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`No pre-genesis blocks allowed`}
  text={`
This runtime and state is for the parachain's _genesis_ block only. You cannot, at this time,
connect a parachain with any previous state to a relay chain. All parachains must start from block 0
on the relay chain. Eventually, migrating a solo chain built on Substrate is expected to be
possible, but this functionality is not planned anytime soon.
`}
/>

### Start the collator node

We can now start the collator node with the following command. Notice that we need to supply the same
relay chain chain spec we used for launching relay chain nodes at the second half of the command.

```bash
# NOTE: this command assumes a para ID of 2000. Change as needed.
./target/release/parachain-collator \
--alice \
--collator \
--force-authoring \
--parachain-id 2000 \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/alice \
--port 40333 \
--ws-port 8844 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain <relay chain raw chain spec> \
--port 30343 \
--ws-port 9977
```

The first thing to notice about this command is that several arguments are passed before the lone
`--`, and several more arguments passed after it. A parachain collator contains the actual
collator node and also an **embedded relay chain node**. The arguments before the `--` are for the
collator, and the arguments after the `--` are for the embedded relay chain node.

We give the collator a base path and ports as we did for the relay chain node previously. We also
specify the para ID.

Remember to change the collator-specific values if you are executing these instructions a second
time for a second parachain. You will use the same relay chain chain spec, but different para ID,
base path, and ports the second parachain collator binds to.

There is presently no way to run a parachain node without the embedded relay chain node, but it is
expected that this will become possible for non-collator nodes eventually.

At this point your _collator's logs_ should look something like this:

You should see your collator node running (alone) and peering with the already
running relay chain nodes. It has not started authoring parachain blocks yet.
Authoring will begin when the collator is actually **registered on the relay chain**.

## Parachain Registration

### Register Using `sudo`

We have our relay chain launched and our parachain collator ready to go. Now we have to register the
parachain on the relay chain. In a production network, this will typically be accomplished
through [parachain auctions](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction). But for this
tutorial we will do it with `sudo` call.

### Registration Transaction

The transaction can be submitted **on a relay chain node** via Polkadot-JS Apps UI. There are
multiple options to go about this, and we can pick any one of the following. Note that all options
here depend on a [`paraID` being reserved](#1-reserve-a-para-id) - so be sure to do that first.

If you are running a network with more than two validators you can add more parachains through the
same interface with the parameters adjusted accordingly. More details on this can be found
[in here](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay#starting-additional-validators-optional).

#### Option 1: `paraSudoWrapper.sudoScheduleParaInitialize`

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`
This option bypasses the slot lease mechanics entirely to onboard a parachain or parathread for a
reserved \`paraID\` starting on the next relay chain session. This is the simplest and fastest way to
go about testing. But note that the parachain will also be automatically off-boarded at the next
period, where any parachains without a lease are downgraded to parathreads, so take note of the
next slot ending period and be sure to re-register as needed.
 `}
/>

- Go to [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/),
  connecting to your **relay chain**.

- Execute a sudo extrinsic on the relay chain by going to `Developer` -> `sudo` page.

- Pick `paraSudoWrapper` -> `sudoScheduleParaInitialize(id, genesis)` as the extrinsic type,
  shown below.

![parachain-registration-sudo.png](../../../../src/images/tutorials/09-cumulus/parachain-registration-sudo.png)

- In the extrinsics parameters, specify:

  - Set the `id: ParaId` to 2,000
  - `genesisHead`: upload the file `para-2000-genesis` (from the previous step)
  - `validationCode`: upload the file `para-2000-wasm` (from the previous step)
  - Set the `parachain: Bool` option to **Yes**.

This dispatch, if successful, will emit the `sudo.Sudid` event, viewable in the relay chain explorer
page.

#### Option 2: `slots.forceLease`

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`
This is the more formal flow for registration used in production (with the exception of
the use of sudo to force a slot lease): you register your reserved \`paraID\` with the _same_
account that reserved it, or use \`sudo\` with a \`registrar.forceRegister\` extrinsic if you wish.
  `}
/>

Here we will use `sudo` to grant ourselves a lease. You should have an onboarded parathread:

![parathread-onboarding.png](../../../../src/images/tutorials/09-cumulus/parathread-onboarding.png)

- Go to [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/),
  connecting to your **relay chain**.

- Execute a sudo extrinsic on the relay chain by going to `Developer` -> `sudo` page.

- Pick `slots`->`forceLease(para, leaser, amount, period_begin, period_end)` as the extrinsic type,
  shown below.

![forceLease.png](../../../../src/images/tutorials/09-cumulus/forceLease.png)

Be sure to set the begin period to the slot you wish to start at. In testing, this is very likely
to be the already active slot `0` if you started a fresh new relay chain. Extending this out to
beyond the time you wish to test this parachain is likely the best, unless you want to test the
onboarding and offboarding cycles. In that case, then electing slot leases that have gaps for a
`paraID` would be in order. Once fully onboarded and after block production starts you should see:

![parachain-active-lease.png](../../../../src/images/tutorials/09-cumulus/parachain-active-lease.png)

### Block production

The collator should start producing parachain blocks (aka collating) once the registration is
successful **and the next relay chain epoch begin**!

> This may take a while! Be patient as you wait for the next epoch to start.
> This is 10 blocks for the example [`rococo-custom-2-raw.json`](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json)
> included in this tutorial.

Finally, the collator should start producing log messages like the following:

```bash
# Notice the relay epoch change! Only then do we start parachain collating!

### Block finalization

The relay chain tracks the latest block (the head) of each parachain. When a relay chain block
is finalized, every parachain blocks that have completed the
[validation process](https://polkadot.network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block) are also finalized.
This is how Polkadot achieves **pooled, shared security** for it's parachains!

We can observed what parachains are registered and what their latest head data is on the
`Network > Parachains` tab in the Apps UI.

## Interact with a parachain

The entire point of launching and registering parachains is that we can submit transactions to the
parachains and interact with them. We are finally ready to submit extrinsics on our parachains!

### Connecting with the Apps UI

We've already connected the Apps UI to the relay chain node. Now we can also connect to the
parachain collator. Open another instance of Apps UI in a new browser window, and connect it to the
appropriate endpoint. If you have followed this workshop so far, you can connect to the
parachain node at:

https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9945#/

### Submit extrinsics

You can make some simple token transfers to ensure that the parachain is operating normally. You can
also make some on-chain remarks by going to the `Extrinsics` page, choosing `System` pallet and
`remark` extrinsic.

If the transaction go through as expected, you have a working parachain. Congratulations!

#### Cross-chain Message Passing (XCMP)

The defining feature of connecting parachains to a _common_ relay chain is the ability to
communicate _between_ all connected chains. This area of functionality is at the cutting edge
development, and for now is not demonstrated in this workshop.

## Chain purging

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Warning`}
  text={`
Your sole collator is the only home of the parachain data as there is only one node
on your entire parachain network. Relay chains only store parachains header information. If the
parachain data is lost, you will **not** be able to recover the chain!
  `}
/>

To purge your parachain chain data, you need to deregister and re-register the parachain collator.
It may be easier in testing to instead just purge all the chains. To purge all chains, run:

```bash
# Purge the collator(s)
./target/release/parachain-collator purge-chain\
  --base-path <your collator DB path set above>

# Purge the validator(s)
polkadot purge-chain\
  --base-path <your relay chain DB path set above>
```

Then register from a blank slate again.

## Connecting additional parachain nodes

A parachain can work with only a single collator as we've shown already. But that configuration is
not very decentralized. An adversary would only need to take down a single node to stall the
parachain.

You should have _at least_ two **validators** (relay chain nodes) running for every **collator**
(parachain nodes) on your network. This is why we have included a prebuilt 3 and 4 validator
chain spec in [the first section](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay#pre-configured-chain-spec-files), and you
can add more as needed, described there.

### Start a second collator

The command to run additional collators is as follows. This command is nearly identical to the one
we used to start the first collator, but we need to avoid conflicting ports and `base-path` directories.

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator \
--bob \
--collator \
--force-authoring \
--parachain-id 2000 \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/bob \
--bootnodes <a running collator node> \
--port 40334 \
--ws-port 9946 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain <relay-chain chain spec> \
--port 30344 \
--ws-port 9978
--bootnodes <other relay chain node>
```

### Non-collating parachain full nodes

It is also possible to start a non-collating full node for a parachain. In this case, simply leave out
the `--collator` flag.

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator \
  --base-path <a DB base path> \
  --bootnodes <Your first collator> \
  --ws-port <Your chosen websocket port> \
  --port <Your chosen libp2p port> \
  --parachain-id <Your ID> \
  -- \
  --chain <relay-chain chain spec> \
  --bootnodes <other relay chain node>
```

## Next steps

That was quite a lot of work to get a parachain up and running! Don't fret though, in the
next section we will learn about how to completely automate all the steps we did in this
tutorial thus far, and much more!
