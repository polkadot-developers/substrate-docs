## Before you begin

In this tutorial you will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain), use
[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus) to create your own parachain, connect it to your
relay chain, and interact with the node sets in a local testnet.

Please learn some about parachains **before** continuing the tutorial:

If you are here _without_ any former Substrate experience, you are likely to not
understand or complete this tutorial. We assume you have completed these tutorials:

- [Create Your First Substrate Chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain)
- [Start a Private Network](/tutorials/v3/private-network)

With those complete, let's dive in!

## Hardware and software requirements

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Hardware requirements`}
  text={`
Compiling this project is a resource intensive process! We suggest using a machine with
**no less than**:
\n
- 8 GB of RAM (16 is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 is suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space
\n
Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely to run out of memory resulting in a \`SIGKILL\`
error. This generally happens on the \`polkadot-service\` build so be sure to monitor your RAM
usage (with something like [htop](https://htop.dev/) and look out as swap memory starting to be
used.
`}
/>

### Build with underpowered hardware

If you **_cannot_** find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solution which trades longer
build time for more limited memory usage.

- Use less threads: cargo's `-j` flag specifies the number of threads to use to build. Try to use
  one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo's [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds, with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.

```bash
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1
```

### Software versioning

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Exact Versions Matter`}
  text={`
You **must** use the _exact_ versions set forth in this tutorial to ensure that you do not run into
conflicts.
\n
At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain's codebase they are
connecting to. If you want to connect your parachian to a **any** relay network, you _must_ be
sure that you are building and testing against the **exact same build of that relay chain** for your
collator!

## Build your nodes

> After you start the builds below and wait for these to complete, read about the
> [parachain template](#parachain-node-template-overview-optional).

In case you have not already, follow the instructions to
[setup a local development environment](/v3/getting-started/overview) for Substrate.

### Building the relay chain node

Clone the Polkadot repository (that will serve as our relay chain), and build the node:

```bash
# Clone the Polkadot Repository
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git

# Switch into the Polkadot directory
cd polkadot

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout v0.9.10

# Build the relay chain Node
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/polkadot --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Polkadot node.

### Building the parachain template

We will use the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template"> Parachain Template </ExternalLink>
(similar but not identical to the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template"> Node Template </ExternalLink>
) to launch our first parachain and make cross-chain asset transfers. Later, we will use it as the starting
point for developing our own parachains.

In a new terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the Parachain Template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the Parachain Template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout polkadot-v0.9.10

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/parachain-collator --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Cumulus-based parachain collator.

## Parachain node template overview (optional)

Substrate developers who are familiar with
the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template">Substrate Node Template</ExternalLink> will
find the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template">Substrate Parachain Template </ExternalLink>
familiar. They have the same general structure featuring `node`, `runtime`, and `pallets`
directories. Their runtimes are similar and feature many of the same pallets. Apart from a few new
traits, the `pallet-template` itself is essentially identical. Many of the [Substrate devhub tutorials](/tutorials/v3)
can be used with few modifications on the Parachain Template.

The similarities between these two templates should give you confidence, that if you've built a
Substrate chain, you will have no problem building a parachain!

### Differences from the node template

There are, however, a few important differences between the two templates that are worth observing at
the outset.

#### Parachain info pallet

This pallet is designed to inject information about the parachain's registration into its own
runtime. Currently it just injects the para ID that the chain is registered at. This allows the
runtime to know which cross-chain messages are intended for it.

#### Message broker pallet

This pallet is responsible for distributing cross-chain messages received over the network to the
pallets that they are intended for. If you intend to receive cross chain messages, you should use
this pallet.

#### `register_validate_block!` macro

Each parachain must supply a `validate_block` function, expressed as a Wasm blob, to the relay chain
when registering. The node template does not provide this function, but the parachain template does.
Thanks to cumulus, creating this function for a Substrate runtime is as simple as adding one line of
code at the bottom of your runtime:

```rust
cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::register_validate_block!(
  Runtime = Runtime,
  BlockExecutor = cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::BlockExecutor::<Runtime, Executive>,
  CheckInherents = CheckInherents,
);
```

#### No `GRANDPA` pallet

Many popular Substrate runtimes including the node template feature a finality-related GRANDPA
pallet and its associated `GrandpaApi`. These are both missing from the parachain template.

This is because parachains follow the finality of the relay chain rather than running their own
finality gadget. This is fundamental to Polkadot's architecture and will not change.

#### Service

The collator's service is entirely different from the node template's. While you can find
similarities, the structure of the service is much different. This new service is the primary change
that cumulus provides.

  title={`Note`}
  text={`When modifying an existing Substrate chain to use Cumulus, it is generally best to copy the
  service code from the template.
  `}
/>

## Relay chain specification

You will need a chain specification ([chain spec](/v3/runtime/chain-specs))
for your relay chain network.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Minimal validators per collator`}
  text={`
Always have one or more relay chain validator node running than the total connected parachains. For
example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more relay chain validator nodes.
`}
/>

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Distribute your raw spec`}
  text={`
If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the
associated chain spec for your network generated once and distributed to your peers.
This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1)
in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.
`}
/>

Chain specification files to connect to an existing network _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder
that is published in your node's codebase for others to use. As an example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res"> here </ExternalLink>
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res"> here </ExternalLink>

### Pre-configured chain spec files

We have included three chain spec files that you can use **without modification** for a
local test network:

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json" download>
    rococo-custom-2-raw.json
  </a>
  : A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering a single parachain.

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json" download>
    {' '}
    rococo-custom-3-raw.json{' '}
  </a>
  : A three-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie as the third validator.

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json" download>
    rococo-custom-4-raw.json
  </a>
  : A four-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie and Dave as the third
  and fourth validators.

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. If
you use a **plain** chain spec (human readable) you want to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw**
chain spec to use when starting your nodes. Jump to the
[conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

These specs were created according to the steps in the
[create your own chain spec](#create-a-custom-chain-spec) section.

## Start your relay chain

Before we can attach any cumulus-based parachains, we need to launch a relay chain to connect to.
This page describes in detail how to start both nodes using the two-validator `rococo-custom-2-raw.json`
chain spec that ships with this tutorial as well as the general instructions for starting additional
nodes.

### Start the `alice` validator

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
./target/release/polkadot \
--alice \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay/alice \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9944
```

The port and websocket port specified here are the defaults and thus those flags can be omitted.
However we've chosen to leave them in to enforce the habit of checking their values. Because Alice
is using the defaults, no other nodes on the relay chain or parachains can use these ports.

When the node starts you will see several log messages. **Take note of the node's Peer ID**
in the logs. We will need it when connecting other nodes to it. It will look something like
this:

```bash
🏷 Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGjsmVmZCM1jPtVNp6hRbbkGBK3LADYNniJAKJ19NUYiq
```

### Start the `bob` validator

```bash
./target/release/\
--bob \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-bob \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30334 \
--ws-port 9945
```

Bob's command is perfectly analogous to Alice's. It differs concretely from Alice's in that Bob has
specified his own base path, provided his own validator keys (`--bob`), and used his own ports.
Finally he has added a `--bootnodes` flag. This bootnodes flag is not strictly necessary if you are
running the entire network on a single local system, but it is necessary when operating over the
network, so I've chosen to leave it in.

### Starting additional validators (optional)

If you are using the `rococo-custom-2-raw.json` spec, you do not need to start additional nodes, but
others may need to start more nodes. Again, this command is entirely analogous. You just need to
make sure that nodes on the same physical system do not have conflicting ports or base paths.

```bash
./target/release/\
--charlie \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-charlie \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30335 \
--ws-port 9946
```

If you would like even more validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other ways, keep
reading!

  link={`../connect-parachain`}
/>

## Create a custom relay chain spec (optional)

It is generally best to start from an existing specification to minimize chances of
error. Once you are familiar with the overall flow, use the following steps to customize and
generate your own chain specs.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`chainspec testing with \`rococo-local\``}
  text={`
Your final spec _must_ start with the word \`rococo\` or the node will not know what runtime logic
to include.
`}
/>

### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
./target/release/build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

That file contains most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so
we just need to add an authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of
the generated spec file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well known accounts used
in other tutorials (Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"session": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)

       }
    ]
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
  ]
}

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. If
you use a **plain** chain spec you will need to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw**
chain spec to use to pass to your nodes on startup. Jump to the
[conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

### Adjust the Chain Spec

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Direct edits vs. building specs`}
  text={`
The addition of custom session keys in the plain chain spec as discussed in this section is
not needed for **production chains**, as these are generated for you in the included chain spec
files in \`node/service/res\` folder of Polkadot. The exercise below is used because you are
you would need to recompile your node only to adding authorities. Minor edits on a plain base
chain spec is useful in this case, but most of the time you will want to include these in your
\`chain-spec.rs\`, generate the node binary, and finally use the CLI to generate your custom chain
spec.
`}
/>

Add your new authority's `AccountId` and `ValidatorId`.

In this runtime configuration, both IDs are the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the
[well-known development accounts](/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

<Message

All the keys and addresses needed can be generated and inspected using either:
- The stand-alone [\`subkey\` tool](/v3/tools/subkey) (v2.0.1 and above for BEEFY keys)
- The node \`key\` subcommand, included in all substrate node CLIs
\n
The commands are equivalent for either one you choose, the sole difference being that the \`key\`
subcommand also includes methods to \`insert\` keys into your nodes.

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Now that you have all the keys you need, append them in the `palletSession` section of you _plain_ spec file.
You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this same process.

#### A note on SS58 encoding of `key` vs. `address`

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys.

In the case of sr25519 and ed25519, the account ID matches its public key, hence SS58 encoded
account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding. In case of ECDSA, we apply blake2 algorithm to the public key to get the address (due to the size
difference between 33 vs 32 bytes), so the SS58 encoding is different.

Default serialization / deserialization implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding,
hence every time we use public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A
notable case is chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).

### Convert plain to raw chain spec

Now that you've modified your chain spec, you can generate the final raw spec file.

```bash
./target/release/build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this warning for
now.

### Start the custom relay chain and insert your own keys

If your custom chain spec includes self-generated keys, see the
