## Before you begin

In this tutorial you will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain), use
[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus) to create your own parachain, and connect it to the
relay chain all in a local testnet environment.

If you aren't familiar with the concept of parachains, please learn about them first **before**
continuing:

- [Parachain Basics](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains)
- [The Path of a Parachain Block](https://polkadot.network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block/)
- [Parachain Development Overview](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-build-with-polkadot)

If you are here _without_ any former Substrate experience, you will likely not be able to
understand or complete this tutorial. We assume you have completed these tutorials:

- [Create Your First Substrate Chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain)
- [Start a Private Network](/tutorials/v3/private-network)

With those complete, let's dive in!

## Hardware and software requirements

<Message

  title={`Hardware requirements`}
  text={`
Compiling this project is a resource intensive process! We suggest using a machine with
**no less than**:
\n
- 8 GB of RAM (16 GB is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 cores are suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space
\n
Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely run out of memory resulting in a \`SIGKILL\`
error during the compilation process, generally happens on building the \`polkadot-service\`
crate. So be sure to monitor your RAM usage with tools like [htop](https://htop.dev/) and look out
as swap memory starting to be used.
`}
/>

### Build with underpowered hardware

If you **_cannot_** find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solutions which trade
longer build times for more limited memory usage.

- Use less threads: cargo `-j` flag specifies the number of threads used to build. Try to use
  one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.

```bash
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
```

### Software versioning

This tutorial has been tested on:

- [Polkadot `v0.9.10`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.10)
- [Substrate Parachain Template `polkadot-v0.9.10`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.10)
- [Polkadot-JS Apps `v.096.2-34`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/commit/1073f1b79bf0aec1c853441e3bbac614defce76e).
  It is generally expected that the [hosted Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
  should work. If you have issues, build and run this UI yourself at this tagged version/commit.

  title={`Exact Versions Matter`}
  text={`
You **must** use the _exact_ versions set forth in this tutorial to ensure that you do not run into
conflicts.\n
At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain codebase they are
connecting to. To have the least amount of hiccups, be sure to use the corresponding tagged
version of Polkadot and Parachain Template when working on this tutorial. So if you are using
[**Polkadot \`v0.9.10\`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.10), use the equivalent
version of [**Parachain Template \`polkadot-v0.9.10\`**](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.10).

## Build your nodes

In case you haven't, please follow the instructions to
[setup a local development environment](/v3/getting-started/overview) for Substrate.

### Building the relay chain node

Polkadot network will serve as our relay chain in this workshop. So clone the **Polkadot**
repository and build the node:

```bash
# Clone the Polkadot Repository
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git

# Switch into the Polkadot directory
cd polkadot

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout v0.9.10

# Build the relay chain Node
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/polkadot --help
```

> After you start the compilation, it will take a while (30 mins to 60 mins) to complete. So go
> ahead and continue to read through the rest of the workshop during the wait 😉

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Polkadot node.

### Building the parachain template

We will use the [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template)
to launch our first parachain and make cross-chain asset transfers. The Parachain Template is
similar but not identical to the [Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template).
Later, we will use this Parachain Template as the starting point for developing our own parachains.

In a new terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the Parachain Template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the Parachain Template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout polkadot-v0.9.10

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/parachain-collator --help
```

> Again, this will take 30 to 60 mins to complete.

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Cumulus-based parachain collator.

## Parachain node template overview

Substrate developers who are familiar with the Substrate Node Template will find the Substrate
Parachain Template familiar. They have the same general structure featuring `node`, `runtime`, and
`pallets` directories. Their runtimes are similar and feature many of the same pallets. Apart from
a few new traits, the `pallet-template` itself is essentially identical. Many of the
[tutorials](/tutorials/v3) can be used with few modifications on the Parachain Template.

The similarities between these two templates should give you confidence that if you've built a
Substrate chain, you will have no problem building a parachain!

### Differences from the node template

There are, however, a few important differences between the two templates that are worth observing at
the outset.

#### Parachain info pallet

Parachain Template runtime ([`runtime/Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/blob/latest/runtime/Cargo.toml))
has integrated [`parachain-info` pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/cumulus/parachain_info/pallet/index.html) in.
This pallet is designed to inject information about the parachain's registration into its own
runtime. Currently it just injects the para ID that the chain is registered at. This allows the
runtime to know which cross-chain messages are intended for it.

#### `register_validate_block!` macro

Each parachain must supply a `validate_block` function, expressed as a Wasm blob, to the relay chain
when registering. The Node Template does not provide this function, but the parachain template does,
Thanks to cumulus, creating this function for a Substrate runtime is as simple as adding one line of
code as shown
[at the bottom of the runtime](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/blob/latest/runtime/src/lib.rs#L648-L652):

```rust
cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::register_validate_block!(
  Runtime = Runtime,
  BlockExecutor = cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::BlockExecutor::<Runtime, Executive>,
  CheckInherents = CheckInherents,
);
```

#### No `GRANDPA` pallet

Many popular Substrate runtimes including the Node Template features a finality-related GRANDPA
pallet and its associated `GrandpaApi`. These are both missing from the Parachain Template.

This is because parachains follow the finality of the relay chain rather than running their own
finality gadget. This is fundamental to Polkadot's architecture and will not change.

#### Service

The collator service
([`node/src/service.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/blob/latest/node/src/service.rs))
is entirely different from the one of Node template. While you can find similarities, the structure
of the service is much different. This new service is the primary change that cumulus provides.

  title={`Note`}
  text={`When modifying an existing Substrate chain to use Cumulus, it is generally best to copy the
  service code from the Parachain Template.
  `}
/>

## Relay chain specification

You will need a chain specification ([chain spec](/v3/runtime/chain-specs)) for your relay chain
network.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Minimal validators per collator`}
  text={`
Always have one or more relay chain validator nodes running than the total connected parachains. For
example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more relay chain validator nodes.
`}
/>

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Distribute your raw spec`}
  text={`
If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the
associated chain spec for your network generated once and distributed to your peers.
This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1)
in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.
`}
/>

Chain specs _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder that is published in your node's
codebase for others to use. For example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain specs
  [under `node/service/res`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain specs
  [under `res`](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res)

### Pre-configured chain spec files

We have included three set of chain spec files in this tutorial that you can use
**without modification** for a local test network:

- A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering a single
  parachain - [plain chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json),
  [raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json).

- A three-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-custom-2-raw` spec, with Charlie as the third
  validator - [plain chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-3-plain.json),
  [raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json).

- A four-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-custom-2-raw` spec, with Charlie and Dave as
  the third and fourth validators -
  [plain chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-4-plain.json),
  [raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json).

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. You
will need to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to use when starting your nodes. Jump
to the [conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

The above raw chain specs were created according to the steps in the
[create your own chain spec](##create-a-custom-relay-chain-spec-optional) section.

## Start your relay chain

Before we can attach any cumulus-based parachains, we need to launch a relay chain for them to
connect to. This section describes in detail how to start both nodes using the above
[two-validator raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json)
as well as the general instructions for starting additional nodes.

### Start the `alice` validator

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
./target/release/polkadot \
--alice \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay/alice \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9944
```

The port (`port`) and websocket port (`ws-port`) specified here are the defaults and thus those
flags can be omitted. However we choose to leave them in to enforce the habit of checking their
values. Once this node is launched, no other nodes on the same local machine can use these ports.

When the node starts you will see several log messages. **Take note of the node's Peer ID**
in the logs. We will need it when connecting other nodes to it. It will look something like
this:

```bash
🏷 Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGjsmVmZCM1jPtVNp6hRbbkGBK3LADYNniJAKJ19NUYiq
```

### Start the `bob` validator

```bash
./target/release/\
--bob \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-bob \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30334 \
--ws-port 9945
```

Bob's command is perfectly analogous to Alice's. It differs from Alice's one by his own base path,
his own validator key (`--bob`), and his own ports. Finally he adds a `--bootnodes` flag. This flag
is not strictly necessary if you are running the entire network on a single local machine, but it is
necessary when operating over the network.

### Starting additional validators (optional)

If you are using the
[two-validator raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json),
you do not need to start additional nodes, but others may need to start more nodes. Again, this
command is entirely analogous. You just need to make sure that nodes on the same local machine do
not have conflicting ports or base paths.

```bash
./target/release/\
--charlie \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-charlie \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30335 \
--ws-port 9946
```

If you would like even more validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other ways, keep
reading!

  link={`../connect-parachain`}
/>

## Create a custom relay chain spec (optional)

It is generally best to start from an existing raw chain specs to minimize chances of
error. Once you are familiar with the overall flow, use the following steps to customize and
generate your own chain specs.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`chain spec testing with \`rococo-local\``}
  text={`
Your final chain spec filename **must** start with \`rococo\` or the node will not know what
runtime logic to include.
`}
/>

### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
./target/release/build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

We have just generated a **plain chain spec** file for `rococo-local` network. That file contains
most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so we just need to add an
authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of the generated spec
file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well-known accounts used in other tutorials
(Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"session": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)
        "im_online": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_validator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_assignment": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "authority_discovery": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "beefy": "KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL",               // <---- The BEEFY *encoded* ecdsa session keys (//Alice)
       }
    ]
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
  ]
}
```

As [mentioned above](#pre-configured-chain-spec-files), we have pre-configured:

- [rococo-custom-2-plain.json](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json)
- [rococo-custom-3-plain.json](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-3-plain.json)
- [rococo-custom-4-plain.json](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-4-plain.json)

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for our inspection. We
will need to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to pass to nodes on startup. Jump to
the [conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

### Adjust the Plain Chain Spec

Then we would adjust the plain chain spec file by adding new authority's `AccountId` and
`ValidatorId`.

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Direct edits vs. building specs`}
  text={`
The addition of custom session keys in the plain chain spec discussed in this section typically is
not needed for **production chains**, as they have been included in the accompanied chain spec
files. The exercise below is done because we have made modifications to the plain chain spec. In
production, most of the time you will want to include these in your
[\`chain-spec.rs\`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/blob/latest/node/src/chain_spec.rs)
to include them in the node binary directly. And then use the  CLI to generate your custom plain
chain spec.
`}
/>

In this case, both IDs are going to be the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the
[well-known development accounts](/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Subkey tool vs. key command`}
  text={`
All the keys and addresses needed can be generated and inspected using either:
- The stand-alone [\`subkey\` tool](/v3/tools/subkey) (v2.0.1 or above)
- The node \`key\` subcommand, included in all substrate node CLIs
\n
These commands are equivalent. The sole difference being that the \`key\` subcommand also includes
methods to \`insert\` keys into your nodes.
`}
/>

Polkadot address for `//Alice` (`sr25519` cryptography). This is used in all but the `beefy`
key sections of the chain spec after the `grandpa` key.

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```text

  SS58 Address:      5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```text
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xcb6df9de1efca7a3998a8ead4e02159d5fa99c3e0d4fd6432667390bb4726854

  Public key (SS58): KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL
  Account ID:        0x01e552298e47454041ea31273b4b630c64c104e4514aa3643490b8aaca9cf8ed
  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Now that you have all the keys needed, append them in the `palletSession` section of you
_plain_ chain spec. You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this
same process.

#### A note on SS58 encoding of `key` vs. `address`

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys. BEEFY is a component built for the feature bridging Substrate to other
blockchain networks.

In the case of sr25519 and ed25519, the account ID matches its public key, hence SS58 encoded
account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding. In case of ECDSA, we apply blake2
algorithm to the public key to get the address (due to the size difference between 33 vs 32 bytes),
so the SS58 encoding is different.

Default serialization / deserialization implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding,
hence every time we use public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A
notable case is chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).

### Convert plain to raw chain spec

Now that you've modified your plain chain spec, you can generate the final raw chain spec by:

```bash
./target/release/build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this warning for
now.

### Start the custom relay chain and insert your own keys

If your custom chain spec includes self-generated keys, see the
[Substrate private network tutorial](/tutorials/v3/private-network#add-keys-to-keystore)
for details on inserting these keys into your various nodes.
