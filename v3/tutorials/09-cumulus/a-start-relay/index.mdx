In this tutorial you will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain), use
[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus) to create your own parachain, and connect it to the
relay chain all in a local testnet environment.

## Before you begin

If you aren't familiar with the concept of parachains, please learn about them first **before**
continuing:

- [Parachain Basics](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains)
- [The Path of a Parachain Block](https://polkadot.network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block/)
- [Parachain Development Overview](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-build-with-polkadot)

If you are here _without_ any former Substrate experience, you will likely not be able to
understand or complete this tutorial. We assume you have completed these tutorials:

- [Create Your First Substrate Chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain)
- [Start a Private Network](/tutorials/v3/private-network)

With those complete, let's dive in!

## Hardware and software requirements

<Message

  title={`Hardware requirements`}
  text={`
Compiling this project is a resource intensive process! We suggest using a machine with
**no less than**:
\n
- 8 GB of RAM (16 GB is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 cores are suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space
\n
Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely run out of memory resulting in a \`SIGKILL\`
error during the compilation process, generally happens on building the \`polkadot-service\`
crate. So be sure to monitor your RAM usage with tools like [htop](https://htop.dev/) and look out
as swap memory starting to be used.
`}
/>

### Build with underpowered hardware

If you **_cannot_** find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solutions which trade
longer build times for more limited memory usage.

- Use less threads: cargo `-j` flag specifies the number of threads used to build. Try to use
  one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.

```bash
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
```

### Software versioning

This tutorial has been tested on:

- [Polkadot `v0.9.11`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.11)
- [Substrate Parachain Template `polkadot-v0.9.11`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.11)
- [Polkadot-JS Apps `v0.98.2-23`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/commit/bfd79288c99df5ef7f73b961c1743ba823871cfd).
  It is generally expected that the [hosted Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
  should work. If you have issues, build and run this UI yourself at this tagged version/commit.

  title={`Exact Versions Matter`}
  text={`
You **must** use the _exact_ versions set forth in this tutorial to ensure that you do not run into
conflicts.\n
At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain codebase they are
connecting to. To have the least amount of hiccups, be sure to use the corresponding tagged
version of Polkadot and Parachain Template when working on this tutorial. So if you are using
[**Polkadot \`v0.9.11\`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.11), use the equivalent
version of [**Parachain Template \`polkadot-v0.9.11\`**](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.11).
  `}

We're doing our best to keep the Parachain Template and this tutorial updated presently
with the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases">latest release of Polkadot.</ExternalLink>

## Build your nodes

In case you haven't, please follow the instructions to
[setup a local development environment](/v3/getting-started/overview) for Substrate.

### Building the relay chain node

Polkadot network will serve as our relay chain in this workshop. So clone the **Polkadot**
repository and build the node:

```bash
# Clone the Polkadot Repository
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git

# Switch into the Polkadot directory
cd polkadot

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout 0.9.11

# Build the relay chain Node
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/polkadot --help
```

> After you start the compilation, it will take a while (30 mins to 60 mins) to complete. So go
> ahead and continue to read through the rest of the workshop during the wait 😉

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Polkadot node.

### Building the parachain template

We will use the [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template)
to launch our first parachain and make cross-chain asset transfers. The Parachain Template is
similar but not identical to the [Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template).
Later, we will use this Parachain Template as the starting point for developing our own parachains.

In a new terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the Parachain Template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the Parachain Template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout polkadot-v0.9.11

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/parachain-collator --help
```

> Again, this will take 30 to 60 mins to complete.

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Cumulus-based parachain collator.

## Relay chain specification

You will need a chain specification ([chain spec](/v3/runtime/chain-specs)) for your relay chain
network.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Minimal validators per collator`}
  text={`
Always have one or more relay chain validator nodes running than the total connected parachains. For
example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more relay chain validator nodes.
`}
/>

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Distribute your raw spec`}
  text={`
If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the
associated chain spec for your network generated once and distributed to your peers.
This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1)
in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.
`}
/>

Chain specs _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder that is published in your node's
codebase for others to use. For example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain specs
  [under `node/service/res`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain specs
  [under `res`](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res)

### Pre-configured chain spec files

We have included three set of chain spec files in this tutorial that you can use
**without modification** for a local test network:

- A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering a single
  parachain - [plain chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json),
  [raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json).

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. You
will need to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to use when starting your nodes. Jump
to the [conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

The above raw chain specs were created according to the steps in the
[create your own chain spec](#create-a-custom-relay-chain-spec-optional) section.

## Start your relay chain

Before we can attach any cumulus-based parachains, we need to launch a relay chain for them to
connect to. This section describes in detail how to start both nodes using the above
[two-validator raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json)
as well as the general instructions for starting additional nodes.

### Start the `alice` validator

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
./target/release/polkadot \
--alice \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay/alice \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9944
```

The port (`port`) and websocket port (`ws-port`) specified here are the defaults and thus those
flags can be omitted. However we choose to leave them in to enforce the habit of checking their
values. Once this node is launched, no other nodes on the same local machine can use these ports.

When the node starts you will see several log messages. **Take note of the node's Peer ID**
in the logs. We will need it when connecting other nodes to it. It will look something like
this:

```bash
🏷 Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGjsmVmZCM1jPtVNp6hRbbkGBK3LADYNniJAKJ19NUYiq
```

### Start the `bob` validator

```bash
./target/release/polkadot \
--bob \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-bob \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30334 \
--ws-port 9945
```

Bob's command is perfectly analogous to Alice's. It differs from Alice's one by his own base path,
his own validator key (`--bob`), and his own ports. Finally he adds a `--bootnodes` flag. This flag
is not strictly necessary if you are running the entire network on a single local machine, but it is
necessary when operating over the network.

### Starting additional validators (optional)

If you are using the
[two-validator raw chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json),
you do not need to start additional nodes, but others may need to start more nodes. Again, this
command is entirely analogous. You just need to make sure that nodes on the same local machine do
not have conflicting ports or base paths.

```bash
./target/release/polkadot \
--charlie \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-charlie \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30335 \
--ws-port 9946
```

## Custom chain specifcations

Optionally, explore the [how-to guide on configuring a custom chain-spec](/how-to-guides/v3/basics/custom-chainspec)
for instructions to tweak the provided
[plain chain spec](/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json))
for addition of more validators without modification of Polkadot's source code.
