## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a permissioned network with Substrate by using the
[node-authorization pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_node_authorization/index.html).
This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete.

You are probably already familiar with public or _permissionless_ blockchain, where everyone
is free to join the network by running a node. In a permissioned network, only authorized
nodes are allowed to perform specific activities, like validate blocks and propagate
transactions. Some examples of where permissioned blockchains may be desired:

- Private (or consortium) networks
- Highly regulated data environments (healthcare, B2B ledgers, etc.)
- Testing pre-public networks at scale

Before you start, we expect that:

- You have completed the
  [Build a PoE Decentralized Application Tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/build-a-dapp/).
- You are conceptually familiar with
  [P2P Networking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/faq#networking) in Substrate. We recommend completing the [Private Network Tutorial](../private-network)
  to get experience with this first.

## What You Will Be Doing

Before we even get started, let's layout what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial. We will:

      '1. Modify the Node Template project to add [node-authorization pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_node_authorization/index.html).',
    url: '/v3/tutorials/permissioned-network/node-authorization-pallet',

<TutorialObjective
  data={{

    '2. Launch multiple nodes and authorize new nodes to join the network by calling the dispatchable calls provided by node-authorization pallet.',

  }}
/>

## Learning outcomes

- Learn how to use the [node-authorization pallet](https://docs.rs/pallet-node-authorization/3.0.0/pallet_node_authorization/) in your runtime
- Learn how to create a permissioned network consisting of multiple nodes
