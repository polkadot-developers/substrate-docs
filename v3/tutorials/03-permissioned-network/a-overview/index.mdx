In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a permissioned network with Substrate by using
[node-authorization pallet](https://docs.rs/pallet-node-authorization/3.0.0/pallet_node_authorization/).
This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete.

You are probably already familiar with public or _permissionless_ blockchain, where everyone
is free to join the network by running a node. In a permissioned network, only authorized
nodes are allowed to perform specific activities, like validate blocks and propagate
transactions. Some examples of where permissioned blockchains may be desired:

- Private (or consortium) networks
- Highly regulated data environments (healthcare, B2B ledgers, etc.)
- Testing pre-public networks at scale

Before you start, we expect that:

- You have completed the
  [Build a PoE Decentralized Application Tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/build-a-dapp/).
- You are conceptually familiar with
  [P2P Networking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-setup-sentry-node#p2p-networking) in Substrate. \* We suggest to complete the [Private Network Tutorial](../start-a-private-network/index)
  to get experince with this first (not required).
