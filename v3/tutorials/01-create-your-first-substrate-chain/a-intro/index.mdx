## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to compile and launch the Substrate Developer Hub Node Template
and interact with it using the Substrate Developer Hub Front-End Template.

This tutorial is aimed at someone who has never touched Substrate before and wants to get a
**basic** and **quick** understanding of what Substrate is all about. We will not be going into
depth about the intricacies of developing on Substrate, but will hopefully satisfy your curiosity so
that you will continue your journey!

This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete. We will be compiling
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code, but you do _not_ need to have any Rust experience to complete
this guide. We provide you with working code and explain how to use it.

We only expect that:

- You are generally familiar with software development and command line interfaces.
- You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms.
- You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.

      '3. Use a front-end template project to interact with the template node.',
    url: '/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain/interact',
  }}
/>

## Learning outcomes
- Learn how to install and use Substrate's node template 
- Learn how to interact with a live Substrate node using Polkadot JS Apps
