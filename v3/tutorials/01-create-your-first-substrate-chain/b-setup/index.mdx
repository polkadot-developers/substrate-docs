## Overview
Normally, we would teach you more about the Substrate blockchain development framework, however,
setting up your computer for Substrate development can take a while.

To make the most of your time, we will have you start the set-up process and
continue to the next section to learn more about Substrate and what we're building while your Substrate node is compiling.

## Steps
### 1. Prerequisites

You will probably need to do some set-up to prepare your computer for Substrate development.

  [official Installation guide](/v3/docs/getting-started/installation).
  After rustup has been installed and configured, and you/'ve configured the 
  Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version you can return to these steps."

### 2. Compiling the Node Template

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can use Git to clone the Substrate Developer Hub Node
Template, which serves as a good starting point for building on Substrate.

i. Clone the Node Template (version `v3.0.0+monthly-2021-05`).

   ```bash
   git clone -b v3.0.0+monthly-2021-05 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
   ```

ii. Compile the Node Template

   ```bash
   cd substrate-node-template
   # NOTE: you should always use the `--release` flag
   cargo build --release
   # ^^ this will take a while!
   ```

  text="You should start building the node template _before_ moving on!
  The time required for the compilation step depends on the hardware you\'re using.
  Refer to the
  [troubleshooting tips page](/v3/docs/getting-started/installation#troubleshooting-substrate-builds)
  if you run into any issues."

### 3. Install the Front-End Template

This tutorial uses a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) front-end template to allow you to interact
with the Substrate-based blockchain node that you should have started compiling in the previous
step. You can use this same front-end template to create UIs for your own projects in the future.

To use the front-end template, you need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), which itself requires
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you don't have these tools, you _must_ install them from these
instructions:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Now you can proceed to set up the front-end template with these commands.

```bash
# Clone the frontend template from github
git clone -b v3.0.0+monthly-2021-05 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template

# Install the dependencies
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```
