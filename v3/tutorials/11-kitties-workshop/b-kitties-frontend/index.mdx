In Part I we created all of the back-end portion of our Kitties application. In this part, it's
time to build a user interface which can access and interact with our custom storage items and
functions. We'll be using:

- [Polkadot-JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/)
- The [Substrate Front-end Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template), a [React app](https://reactjs.org/)
  that wraps Polkadot-JS API to make it easier to make RPC's to our chain's runtime.
- A [library for generating Cat avatars](https://framagit.org/Deevad/cat-avatar-generator),
  licensed under [CC-By 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) attribution. Thank you
  [David Revoy's](https://framagit.org/Deevad) for making this available.

In Part 2, there will only be two main sections: the first focusing on setting up the front-end
template and the second focusing on building custom React components that can interact with our
Kitty node.

In case you get stuck, the complete solution for this part of the tutorial
can be found [here](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/tree/tutorials/solutions/kitties).

## Getting started

The first step of this tutorial is to familiarize yourself with the Substrate Front-end template.
In this step we will go through an overview of what our React app will look like and the different
components we'll be building. Start by [installing the Front-end Template][substrate-frontend-template]
from your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template.git
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```

Open the template in a code editor. You'll notice the following structure (we're only including the directories we care about for this
tutorial):

```
substrate-front-end-template
|
+-- public
|   |
|   +-- assets              <-- Kitty avatar PNG files
|
+-- src                     <-- our React components
|   |
|   +-- __tests__
|   |
|   +-- config              <-- where to specify our custom types
|   |
|   +-- substrate-lib       <-- lib to give access to PolkadotJS API
|   |   |
|   |   +-- components      <-- contains TxButton, used throughout our application
|   |
|   ...
...
```

In a separate terminal, start an instance of `node-kitties` that you built in Part I (or use the [Kitty node
solution](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/tutorials/kitties)
instead if you haven't completed part I):

```bash
# Launch `node-kitties` from its directory.
cd kitties/
./target/release/node-kitties --dev --tmp
```

Now, in the same directory as where you installed the Front-end template, launch it:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see a tab open up with the front-end template displaying basic features of your chain.
Notice that it comes with a number of prebuilt components to provide basic interactions with a Substrate
Node Template blockchain.

### Sketching out our components

[Substrate front-end template][substrate-frontend-template] components use Polkadot-JS API and
RPC endpoints to communicate with a Substrate node. This allows us to use it to read storage items,
and make extrinsics by calling our pallet's dispatchable functions. Before we get to that, let's
sketch out the different parts of our application.

We'll be building out a total of 3 components:

1. `Kitties.js`: this will render the Kitty pane, and contains the logics of fetching all kitties
   information from the connecting Substrate node.

2. `KittyCards.js`: this will render a React card component containing a Kitty's relevant
   information, avatar and buttons to interact with it.

3. `KittyAvatar.js`: this will handle the logic to map Kitty DNA to the library of PNGs we're using
   to create unique Kitty avatars.

### Polkadot JS API Basics

Before moving on to the next section, we reccommend you read a little Polkadot JS API documentation
to understand the basics of how we will be querying storage and triggering transactions. Here are
some good resources:

- [Basics and Metadata](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/basics)
- [RPC queries](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/api.rpc)
- [Storage methods](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/storage) such as
  `api.query.<pallet>.<method>` to access a pallet instance in a runtime
- [Extrinsics methods](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/extrinsics) such as
  `api.tx.<pallet>.<method>` to trigger a transaction.

## Creating custom components

### Create `Kitties.js`

This is the component that will get rendered by `Apps.js`, the top-most level component. So it does
the heavy lifting, with the help of `KittyAvatar.js` and `KittCards.js`.

1.  Start by creating a file called `Kitties.js` in `src` and paste the following imports:

    ````js
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
    import { Form, Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react'

    import { useSubstrateState } from './substrate-lib'
    import { TxButton } from './substrate-lib/components'

    import KittyCards from './KittyCards'
    ````

    The way our custom components make use of Polkadot-JS API is by using `substrate-lib`, which is a
    wrapper around [Polkadot JS API instance](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/create/) and
    allows us to retrieve account keys from the [Polkadot-JS keyring](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/keyring).
    This is why we use `useSubstrateState` which is exported by `src/substrate-lib/SubstrateContext.js` and
    used to create the wrapper.

1.  Proceed by pasting in the following code snippet:

    ```js
    const parseKitty = ({ dna, price, gender, owner }) => ({
      dna,
      price: price.toJSON(),
      gender: gender.toJSON(),
      owner: owner.toJSON(),
    })

    export default function Kitties(props) {
      const { api, keyring } = useSubstrateState()
      const [kittyIds, setKittyIds] = useState([])
      const [kitties, setKitties] = useState([])
      const [status, setStatus] = useState('')
      // snip
    ```

    The above code handles a few important things for our application:

    - `parseKitty` is a function to hold all kitty data and return an object
    - `Kitties` enables us to subscribe to chain storage item changes and use the `useEffect`
    React hook to update the state of our other components.

    There are two things our app needs to subscribe to: storage changes in the amount of Kitties and
    changes in Kitty objects. To do this we'll create [a subscription](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
    function for each.

    We'll use `api.query.substrateKitties.countForKitties` to listen for a change in the amount of Kitties,
    which will query `CountForKitties` from our Kitties pallet storage item. Then,
    we'll use the `api.query.substrateKitties.kitties` method from Polkadot-JS API to get all kitty data and transform them
    with the `parseKitty()` function.

1.  To enable this, paste the following snippet:

    ```js
    // Subscription function for kitty count
    const subscribeCount = () => {
      let unsub = null

      const asyncFetch = async () => {
        unsub = await api.query.substrateKitties.countForKitties(async count => {
          // Fetch all kitty keys
          const entries = await api.query.substrateKitties.kitties.entries()
          const ids = entries.map(entry => entry[1].unwrap().dna)
          setKittyIds(ids)
        })
      }

      asyncFetch()

      return () => {
        unsub && unsub()
      }
    }
    ```

1.  Similarly for `subscribeKitties`, paste the following code snippet:

    ```js
    // Subscription function to construct all kitty objects
    const subscribeKitties = () => {
      let unsub = null

      const asyncFetch = async () => {
        unsub = await api.query.substrateKitties.kitties.multi(
          kittyIds,
          kitties => {
            const kittiesMap = kitties.map(kitty => parseKitty(kitty.unwrap()))
            setKitties(kittiesMap)
          }
        )
      }

      asyncFetch()

      return () => {
        unsub && unsub()
      }
    }
    ```

    `kitties` is a [storage map](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/latest/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageMap.html), Substrate supports returning the whole map of objects and we use Polkadot-JS API to iterate through the map.
    For each dataset, `parseKitty()` function is called to return a kitty object.

    Lastly, notice the clean-up function is being returned:

    ```js
    // return the unsubscription cleanup function
    return () => {
      unsub && unsub();
    };
    ```

    In `asyncFetch` we have subscribed to the Kitties storage.
    When the component is teared down, we want to make sure the subscription is cleaned up (unsubscribed).
    So we return a clean up function for the effect hook.
    Refer to [Effects with Cleanup](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#effects-with-cleanup) to learn more about cleanup functions.

1.  Now, all that's left to do in order for our component to listen for changes in our node's storage is to pass in `subscribeCount` and `subscribeKitties` functions to React's `useEffect()`.

    Add these lines to enable this:

    ```js
    useEffect(subscribeCount, [api, keyring])
    useEffect(subscribeKitties, [api, keyring, kittyIds])
    ```

Congratulations! We have setup the ground work of accessing the chain and saving all Kitty information
internally using React. We'll come back to the `Kitties.js` component later once we create all the missing
components of our application to complete it.

### Create `KittyAvatar.js`

In this component, all we're doing is mapping a library of PNG images to the bytes of our Kitty DNA.
Since it's mostly all Javascript, we won't be going into much detail.

1. Create a file called `KittyAvatar.js` in the `src` folder of your project and paste in the following
   code:

   ```js
   import React from 'react'

   // Generate an array [start, start + 1, ..., end] inclusively
   const genArray = (start, end) =>
     Array.from(Array(end - start + 1).keys()).map(v => v + start)

   const IMAGES = {
     accessory: genArray(1, 20).map(
       n => `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/accessorie_${n}.png`
     ),
     body: genArray(1, 15).map(
       n => `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/body_${n}.png`
     ),
     eyes: genArray(1, 15).map(
       n => `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/eyes_${n}.png`
     ),
     mouth: genArray(1, 10).map(
       n => `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/mouth_${n}.png`
     ),
     fur: genArray(1, 10).map(
       n => `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/fur_${n}.png`
     ),
   }

   const dnaToAttributes = dna => {
     const attribute = (index, type) =>
       IMAGES[type][dna[index] % IMAGES[type].length]

     return {
       body: attribute(0, 'body'),
       eyes: attribute(1, 'eyes'),
       accessory: attribute(2, 'accessory'),
       fur: attribute(3, 'fur'),
       mouth: attribute(4, 'mouth'),
     }
   }

   const KittyAvatar = props => {
     const outerStyle = { height: '160px', position: 'relative', width: '50%' }
     const innerStyle = {
       height: '150px',
       position: 'absolute',
       top: '3%',
       left: '50%',
     }
     const { dna } = props

     if (!dna) return null

     const cat = dnaToAttributes(dna)
     return (
       <div style={outerStyle}>
         <img alt="body" src={cat.body} style={innerStyle} />
         <img alt="fur" src={cat.fur} style={innerStyle} />
         <img alt="mouth" src={cat.mouth} style={innerStyle} />
         <img alt="eyes" src={cat.eyes} style={innerStyle} />
         <img alt="accessory" src={cat.accessory} style={innerStyle} />
       </div>
     )
   }

   export default KittyAvatar
   ```

   Notice that the only property being passed in is `dna`, which will be passed from `KittyCards.js`.

1. The logic in this component is based on a specific Cat Avatar library of PNGs.
   [Download it](https://framagit.org/Deevad/cat-avatar-generator/-/tree/master/avatars/cat)
   and paste the contents of `avatars/cat` inside a new folder called **`KittyAvatar`** under your project's `public/assets`
   folder.

1. Save and close `KittyAvatar.js`.

### Write `TransferModal` in `KittyCards.js`

Our `KittyCards.js` component will have three sections to it:

- `TransferModal`, `SetPrice`, `BuyKitty`: they are modal dialogs that uses the `TxButton` component to transfer a kitty, set a kitty price, and to buy a kitty.

- `KittyCard`: a card that renders the Kitty avatar using the `KittyAvatar` component as well
  as all other Kitty information (id, dna, owner, gender and price).

- `KittyCards`: a component that renders a grid for `KittyCard` (yes, singular!) described above.

1.  As a preliminary step, create a new file called `KittyCards.js` and add the following imports:

    ```js
    import React from 'react'
    import {
      Button,
      Card,
      Grid,
      Message,
      Modal,
      Form,
      Label,
    } from 'semantic-ui-react'

    import KittyAvatar from './KittyAvatar'
    import { useSubstrateState } from './substrate-lib'
    import { TxButton } from './substrate-lib/components'
    ```

    Let's outline what the `TransferModal` will do. Conveniently, the Substrate Front-end Template comes
    with a component called `TxButton` which is a useful way to include a transfer button that interacts
    with a node. This component will allow us to send a transaction into our node and trigger a
    signed extrinsic for the Kitties pallet.

    The way it is built can be broken down into the following pieces:

    - A "transfer" button exists, which opens up a modal upon being clicked.
    - This modal, we'll call "Kitty Transfer" is a `Form` containing (1) the Kitty ID and (2) an input
    field for a receiving address.
    - It also contains a "transfer" and "cancel" button.

    See the screenshot for reference:

    ![Kitty Transfer](../../../../src/images/tutorials/11-kitties-workshop/kitty-transfer-shot.png)

    The other two modal dialogs, `SetPrice` and `BuyKitty`, follow the similar logics.

1.  The first thing we'll do is to extract the properties (or "props") we need using React hooks.
    These are: `kitty`, `accountPair` and `setStatus`. Do this by pasting in the following code snippet:

    ```js
    const TransferModal = props => {
      const { kitty, accountPair, setStatus } = props;
      const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
      const [formValue, setFormValue] = React.useState({});

      const formChange = key => (ev, el) => {
        setFormValue({ ...formValue, [key]: el.value });
      };
    ```

    We also need a `confirmAndClose` function to be passed into the `TxButton` component, being called
    when a confirmation action is triggered. This function will receive an unsubscription function from
    `TxButton`. In addition to calling this function for clean up, we will just close the modal dialog box.
    Paste the following snippet:

    ```js
    const confirmAndClose = unsub => {
      setOpen(false)
      if (unsub && typeof unsub === 'function') unsub()
    }
    ```

    Our Kitty Card has a "transfer" button that opens up a
    modal where a user can choose an address to send their Kitty to. That modal will have:

    - a Title
    - an read-only field for a Kitty ID
    - an input field for an Account ID
    - a "Cancel" button which closes the Transfer modal
    - the `TxButton` React component to trigger the transaction

1.  Paste this in to complete `TransferModal` and read the
    comments to follow what each piece of code is doing:

    ```js
    return (
      <Modal
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}
        open={open}
        trigger={
          <Button basic color="blue">
            Transfer
          </Button>
        }
      >
        <Modal.Header>Kitty Transfer</Modal.Header>
        <Modal.Content>
          <Form>
            <Form.Input fluid label="Kitty ID" readOnly value={kitty.dna} />
            <Form.Input
              fluid
              label="Receiver"
              placeholder="Receiver Address"
              onChange={formChange('target')}
            />
          </Form>
        </Modal.Content>
        <Modal.Actions>
          <Button basic color="grey" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <TxButton
            label="Transfer"
            type="SIGNED-TX"
            setStatus={setStatus}
            onClick={confirmAndClose}
            attrs={{
              palletRpc: 'substrateKitties',
              callable: 'transfer',
              inputParams: [formValue.target, kitty.dna],
              paramFields: [true, true],
            }}
          />
        </Modal.Actions>
      </Modal>
    )
    ```

The next part of our `KittyCards.js` component is to create the part that renders the
`KittyAvatar.js` component and the data passed in from the `kitties` props in `Kitty.js`.

### Write `KittyCard` in `KittyCards.js`

We'll use Semantic UI `Card` component to create a card that renders the Kitty avatar as well as the
Kitty ID, DNA, gender, owner and price.

1. As you might have guessed, we'll use React props to pass in data to our KittyCard. Paste the
   following code snippet:

    ```js
    // Use props
    const KittyCard = props => {
      const { kitty, setStatus } = props
      const { dna = null, owner = null, gender = null, price = null } = kitty
      const displayDna = dna && dna.toJSON()
      const { currentAccount } = useSubstrateState()
      const isSelf = currentAccount.address === kitty.owner
      // snip
    ```

1. Write out the contents for the `Card` component. Paste the following and read the comments to
   understand what each line is doing:

    ```js
    return (
      <Card>
        {isSelf && (
          <Label as="a" floating color="teal">
            Mine
          </Label>
        )}
        {/* Render the Kitty Avatar */}
        <KittyAvatar dna={dna.toU8a()} />
        <Card.Content>
          {/* Display the Kitty DNA */}
          <Card.Meta style={{ fontSize: '.9em', overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
            DNA: {displayDna}
          </Card.Meta>
          {/* Display the Kitty Gender, Owner, and Price */}
          <Card.Description>
            <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>Gender: {gender}</p>
            <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>Owner: {owner}</p>
            <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
              Price: {price || 'Not For Sale'}
            </p>
          </Card.Description>
        </Card.Content>
        // snip...
    ```

    Before closing the `<Card/>` component we want to render the `TransferModal` and `SetPrice` components we previously built
    &mdash; **only if the Kitty is transferrable by its owner**. Paste this code snippet to handle this
    functionality:

    ```js
    <Card.Content extra style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
      {owner === currentAccount.address ? (
        <>
          <SetPrice kitty={kitty} setStatus={setStatus} />
          <TransferModal kitty={kitty} setStatus={setStatus} />
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <BuyKitty kitty={kitty} setStatus={setStatus} />
        </>
      )}
    </Card.Content>
    </Card>
    ```

1. It's time to put all the pieces we've built together. We need a function to:

    - Check whether there are any Kitties to render and render a _"No Kitty found here... Create one now!"_
       message if there aren't any.
    - If there are, render them in a 3 column grid.

    Have a look at the comments to understand the parts of this code snippet and paste it in `KittyCards.js`:

    ```js
    const KittyCards = props => {
      const { kitties, setStatus } = props

      if (kitties.length === 0) {
        return (
          <Message info>
            <Message.Header>
              No Kitty found here... Create one now!&nbsp;
              <span role="img" aria-label="point-down">
                👇
              </span>
            </Message.Header>
          </Message>
        )
      }

      return (
        <Grid columns={3}>
          {kitties.map((kitty, i) => (
            <Grid.Column key={`kitty-${i}`}>
              <KittyCard kitty={kitty} setStatus={setStatus} />
            </Grid.Column>
          ))}
        </Grid>
      )
    }
    ```

1. Complete the component by adding:

   ```js
   export default KittyCards
   ```

> Notes: We didn't go through the `SetPrice` and `BuyKitty` components above. Please [refer to the solutions](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/blob/tutorials%2Fsolutions%2Fkitties/src/KittyCards.js) for that.

### Complete `Kitties.js`

Now that we've built all the bits for our front-end application, we can piece everything together.

1. Go back to the incompleted `Kitties.js` file and paste this code snippet to render the
   `KittyCard.js` component inside a `<Grid/>`:

   ```js
   return <Grid.Column width={16}>
     <h1>Kitties</h1>
     <KittyCards kitties={kitties} setStatus={setStatus}/>
   ```

1. Now we'll use the `<Form/>` component to render our application's `TxButton` component. Paste in the following
   snippet:

   ```js
       <Form style={{ margin: '1em 0' }}>
         <Form.Field style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
           <TxButton
             label='Create Kitty'
             type='SIGNED-TX'
             setStatus={setStatus}
             attrs={{
               palletRpc: 'substrateKitties',
               callable: 'createKitty',
               inputParams: [],
               paramFields: []
             }}
           />
         </Form.Field>
       </Form>
       <div style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>{status}</div>
     </Grid.Column>;
   }
   ```

### Update App.js

Now all that's left to do is connect our custom components to the main application.

1. In `App.js`, import the `Kitties.js` component:

   ```js
   import Kitties from './Kitties'
   ```

1. Finally, to render `Kitties.js`, add a new row to `<Container/>`:

   ```js
   <Grid.Row>
     <Kitties />
   </Grid.Row>
   ```

If you get stuck in any of the above section. You can refer back to the complete source code of:

- [`src/kitties.js`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/blob/tutorials%2Fsolutions%2Fkitties/src/Kitties.js)
- [`src/kittyCards.js`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/blob/tutorials%2Fsolutions%2Fkitties/src/KittyCards.js)
- [`src/kittyAvatar.js`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/blob/tutorials%2Fsolutions%2Fkitties/src/KittyAvatar.js)

**🎉\***Congratulations!**\*🎉** You have finished the Substrate Kitties front-end tutorial!
We encourage you to write additional functions for other capabilities exposed by your runtime, such as "Set Price", "Buy" or "Breed".
In [our solution](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/blob/tutorials%2Fsolutions%2Fkitties/src/KittyCards.js), we implemented the Set Price modal for you to use as an additional example.
There are lots of ways you can extend what you've learnt here, such as creating a marketplace for different types of avatars, or recreating this front-end with your own UI components.
