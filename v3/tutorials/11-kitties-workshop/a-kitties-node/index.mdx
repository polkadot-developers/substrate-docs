## Introduction

![image](/img/tutorials/kitties-workshop/kitties-tutorial.png)

Welcome to the Substrate Kitties workshop. This workshop is split into two separate parts, designed
to teach you everything you need to know about building a blockchain that handles the creation and
ownership management of Substrate Kitties. Part I will cover how to build the Kitties pallet,
including the functionality to interact with the Kitties we create, such as transferring, buying
and setting prices. Part II will cover developing the Front-end UI to interact with the blockchain
we build in Part I.

You may find it useful to come back to this section as you progress through each part &mdash; just
to keep track of the bigger picture.

## Tutorial Objectives

- Learn basic patterns for building and running a Substrate node.
- Write and integrate a custom FRAME pallet to your runtime.
- Use structs in storage and how to create and update storage items.
- Write pallet extrinsics and helper functions.
- Use the PolkadotJS API to connect a Substrate node to a custom a front-end.

This tutorial assumes that you have already installed the prerequisites for building with Substrate
on your machine. If you haven't already, head over to our
[installation guide](/v3/getting-started/installation).

### What We're Building

In Part I of this tutorial, we'll intentionally keep things simple so that you can decide on how
you'd like to improve your Substrate Kitties chain later on. For the purposes of what we're building,
Kitties really can only do the following things:

- Be created either by some original sources or by being bred using existing Kitties.

- Be sold at a price set by their owner.

- Be transferred from one owner to another.

**In Part I, we'll go over:**

1. [**Basic setup**](#basic-set-up) - we'll need to spin up a
Substrate node and create a custom pallet.

2. [**Runtime storage**](#basic-set-up) - we'll need a total of three
storage items in our pallet to keep track of the amount of Kitties, their owners, and a `Kitty`
object containing a single Kitty's information.

3. [**Dispatchable functions**](#dispatchables-events-and-errors) - we'll
need a total of 5 dispatchable functions: `create`, `set_price`, `transfer`, `buy_kitty`, and
`breed_kitty`.

4. [**Private functions**](#dispatchables-events-and-errors) - we'll write a few
helper functions to handle the heavy lifting logics, and

5. [**Helper functions**](#interacting-with-your-kitties) - we'll write
two helper functions for our dispatchable functions: `mint` and `transfer_from`.

**In Part II, we will:**

1. [**Create a UI for interacting with our pallet's storage items**](../pt2)
- we'll connect to Substrate Front-end Template and create the UI for each dispatchable calls.

2. [**Enhance our UX with Polkadot JS API**](../pt2).

In any case, if you are stuck in following the tutorial, you can always refer back to the full
working source code at the following:

- On Substrate side, it is under [Substrate Node Template repository `tutorials/kitties` branch](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/tutorials/kitties).
Most of the code changes are under `/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs`.

- On the front end side, it is under [Substrate Front-end Template repository `tutorials/kitties` branch](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/tree/tutorials/kitties).
Most of the code changes are within these three files: `/src/[Kitties.js, KittyCards.js, KittyAvatar.js]`.

### What We Won't Cover

The following fall outside the scope of this tutorial:

 - Writing tests for our pallet.

 You can refer to the [how-to guides](/how-to-guides) on how to do this once you've completed this
 tutorial series.

## Basic Set-up

Before we can start making Kitties, we first need to do a little groundwork. This part covers the
basic patterns involved with using the Substrate Node Template to set up a custom pallet and
include a simple storage item.

### Set-up Your Template Node

The [Substrate Node Template][substrate-node-template] provides us with an "out-of-the-box"
blockchain node. Our biggest advantage in using it are that both networking and consensus layers
are already built and all we need to focus on is building out our [runtime][runtime-kb] and
[pallet][pallets-kb] logics. Before we get there, we need to set-up our project in terms of naming
and dependencies.

We'll use a CLI tool called [kickstart][kickstart-tool] to easily rename our node template.

In the root directory of your local workspace, run the following command:

```bash
kickstart https://github.com/sacha-l/kickstart-substrate
```

This command will clone a copy of the most recent Node Template and ask how you would like to call
your node and pallet. Type in:

- `kitties` - as the name of our node. The node will be named as `node-kitties`.
- `kitties` - as the name of your pallet. The pallet will be named as `pallet-kitties`.

This will create a directory called `kitties` with a copy of the [Substrate Node Template][substrate-node-template]
containing the name changes that correspond our template node, runtime, and pallet.

Open the `kitties` directory in your favorite code editor and rename it to `kitties-tutorial`.
Renaming this directory will be helpful once you start creating other projects with the node
template &mdash; it'll help keep things organized!

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`Notice the directories that the \`kickstart\` command modified:
- **\`/node/\`** - This contains all the logic that allows your node to interact with your runtime
and RPC clients.
- **\`/pallets/\`** - Here's where all your custom pallets live.
- **\`/runtime/\`** - This is where all pallets (both custom "internal" and "external" ones) are
aggregated and implemented for the chain's runtime.
  `}
/>

By default, you'll notice that the instance of our modified template pallet name remains
`TemplateModule`. Change it to `SubstrateKitties` (in `runtime/src/lib.rs`):

```rust
construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
    Block = Block,
    NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
    UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
    {
        // --snip
        SubstrateKitties: pallet_kitties::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
    }
);
```

We can already build the node as is by navigating to directory `kitties` in terminal and running
this command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

It's normal if this command takes a little while depending on your machine &mdash; it's building a
whole bunch of crates from the Substrate crates and libraries. The nice thing is that once we run
this command the first time, it won't need to rebuild all the crates when we build subsequent times.

Assuming that your node builds successfully, launch it in development mode to make sure it works:

```bash
./target/release/node-kitties --tmp --dev
```

You should see blocks being created in your terminal. The `--tmp` and `--dev` flags mean we're
running a temporary node in development mode.

### Write Out `pallet_kitties` Scaffold

We'll be spending most of this tutorial in the `pallets` directory of our template node. Let's take
a glance at the folder structure in our workspace:

```bash
kitties-tutorial           <--  The name of our project directory
|
+-- node
|
+-- pallets
|   |
|   +-- kitties
|       |
|       +-- Cargo.toml
|       |
|       +-- src
|           |
|           +-- lib.rs     <-- Remove contents
|           |
|           +-- mock.rs    <-- Remove file
|           |
|           +-- tests.rs   <-- Remove file
|
+-- Cargo.toml
```

> You can go ahead and remove `mock.rs` and `tests.rs`. **We won't be learning about
> using these in this tutorial. Have a look at [this how-to guide](/how-to-guides/v3/testing/transfer-function) if
> you're curious to learn how testing works.**

[Pallets][pallets-kb] in Substrate are used to define runtime logic. In our case, we'll be creating
a single pallet that manages all of the logics of our Substrate Kitties application.

Let's lay out the basic structure of our pallet by outlining the parts inside the
`pallets/mykitties/src/lib.rs`.

Notice that our pallet's directory `pallets/kitties/` is not the same as our pallet's name. The name
of our pallet as Cargo understands it is `pallet-kitties`.

Every FRAME pallet has:

- A set of `frame_support` and `frame_system` dependencies.
- Required [attribute macros][macros-kb] (i.e. configuration traits, storage items and function
calls).

<Message

  title={`Information`}
  text={`
We'll be updating additional dependencies as we progress through the next parts of this tutorial.
  `}/>

Here's the most bare-bones version of the Kitties pallet we will be building in this tutorial. It
contains the starting point for  adding code for the next sections of this tutorial, with comments
marked with **TODO** to indicate code we will be writing later, and **ACTION** to indicate code
that will be written in the current part of the tutorial.

Paste the following code in `/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
    use frame_support::{sp_runtime::traits::{Hash, Zero},
                        dispatch::{DispatchResultWithPostInfo, DispatchResult},
                        traits::{Currency, ExistenceRequirement, Randomness},
                        pallet_prelude::*};
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;
    use sp_core::H256;

    // TODO Part II: Struct for holding Kitty information.

    // TODO Part II: Enum and implementation to handle Gender type in Kitty struct.

    #[pallet::pallet]
    #[pallet::generate_store(trait Store)]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    /// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types it depends on.
    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: pallet_balances::Config + frame_system::Config {
        /// Because this pallet emits events, it depends on the runtime's definition of an event.
        type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;

        /// The Currency handler for the Kitties pallet.
        type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;

        // TODO Part II: Specify the custom types for our runtime.

    }

    // Errors.
    #[pallet::error]
    pub enum Error<T> {
        // TODO Part III
    }

    #[pallet::event]
    #[pallet::metadata(T::AccountId = "AccountId")]
    #[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
    pub enum Event<T: Config> {
        // TODO Part III
    }

    // ACTION: Storage item to keep a count of all existing Kitties.

    // TODO Part II: Remaining storage items.

    // TODO Part III: Our pallet's genesis configuration.

    #[pallet::call]
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {

        // TODO Part III: create_kitty

        // TODO Part III: set_price

        // TODO Part III: transfer

        // TODO Part III: buy_kitty

        // TODO Part III: breed_kitty
    }

    // TODO Parts II: helper function for Kitty struct

    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        // TODO Part III: helper functions for dispatchable functions

        // TODO: increment_nonce, random_hash, mint, transfer_from

    }
}
```

Now try running the following command to rebuild your chain:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Get an error about dependencies? That's normal! Our pallet is using `sp-io` which isn't part of the
node template so we must specify it ourselves. In `pallets/mykitties/Cargo.toml`,  add the
following:

```TOML
[dependencies.sp-io]
default-features = false
git = 'https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git'
tag = 'monthly-2021-08'
version = '4.0.0-dev'
```

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Warning`}
  text={`
Check that you're using the correct \`monthly-*\` tag and version otherwise you will get a
dependency error. Here, we're using \`monthly-2021-08\` tag of Substrate.
  `}
/>

Now run `cargo build --release` again to make sure it builds without errors.

You'll notice the Rust compiler giving you warnings about unused imports. That's fine! Just ignore
them &mdash; we're going to be using those imports in the later parts of the tutorial.

In the next step we will include the first storage item our Kitty application will require.

### Include a Storage Item to Track All Kitties

Let's start by adding the most simple logic we can to our runtime: a function which stores a
variable in runtime.

To do this we'll use [`StorageValue`][storagevalue-rustdocs] from Substrate's
[storage API][storage-api-rustdocs] which is a trait that depends on the [storage macro][storage-macro-kb].

All that means for our purposes is that for any storage item we want to declare, we must include the
`#[pallet::storage]`  macro beforehand. Learn more about declaring storage items [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/storage#declaring-storage-items).

In `pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs`, replace the ACTION line with:

```rust
  #[pallet::storage]
  #[pallet::getter(fn kitty_cnt)]
  /// Keeps track of the number of Kitties in existence.
  pub(super) type KittyCnt<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery>;
```

This creates a storage item for our pallet to keep track of the total count of Kitties in existence.

### Build a Pallet

From the previous step, your pallet should contain a storage item called `KittyCnt` which keeps
track of a single `u64` value. As part of the basic setup, we're doing great!

As mentioned in the [overview of this tutorial](#tutorial-objectives), you'll be implementing 3
storage items in total which you'll discover as you write out your pallet's logic in the next parts.

Before we move on, let's make sure everything compiles. We don't need to rebuild our entire node
each time we update our pallet. Instead, we can use a command that only builds our pallet. From
inside your pallet directory, run the following:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-kitties
```

Does your pallet compile without error? Well done if it does! If not, go back and check that all the
macros are in place and that you've included the FRAME dependencies.

## Uniqueness, Custom Types, and Storage Maps

<Message type='yellow' title='Learning Outcome' text={`
In this part of the tutorial, we'll build out the components of our pallet needed to manage the
creation and ownership of our Kitties. We will learn about:\n\n
- Writing a struct in a \`StorageMap\` to store details about our Kitties.
- Using the \`Randomness\` trait to create unique Kitties.
- Creating our pallet's remaining storage items.
`}/>

This part of the tutorial dives into some pillar concepts for developing pallets with FRAME
(stands for **Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities**). On top of learning how
to use existing types and traits, you'll learn how create your own types like providing your pallet
with a `Gender` type. At the end of this part, you will have implemented the remaining two storage
items according to the logic outlined for the Substrate Kitty application [in the overview of this
tutorial](#what-were-building).

### Scaffold Kitty Struct

We added additional comments to the code from Part I (in the `/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs` file)
to better assist you with the action items in this part of the tutorial. To follow each step with
ease, you can just replace your code with the [helper code](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-how-to-guides/blob/main/static/code/kitties-tutorial/02-create-kitties.rs)

#### A. What Information to Include

**Struct** in Rust is a useful construct to help storing data that have things in common. For our
purposes, our Kitty will carry multiple properties which we can store in a single struct instead
of using separate storage items. This comes in handy when trying to optimize for storage reads and
writes so our runtime can perform less read/writes to update multiple values. Read more about
storage best practices [here][storage-best-practice-kb].

Let's first go over what information a single Kitty will carry:

- **`dna`**: the hash used to identify the DNA of a Kitty, which corresponds to its unique features.
  DNA is also used to breed new Kitties and to keep track of different Kitty generations.
- **`price`**: this is a balance that corresponds to the amount needed to buy a Kitty and
  set by its owner.
- **`gender`**: an enum that can be either `Male` or `Female`.
- **`owner`**: an account ID designating a single owner.

#### B. Sketching Out the Types Held by Our Struct

Looking at the items of our struct from above, we can deduce the following types:

- **`[u8; 16]`** for `dna` - to use 16 bytes to represent a Kitty's DNA.
- **`BalanceOf`** for `price` - this is a custom type using FRAME's [`Currency` trait][currency-frame].
- **`Gender`** for `gender` - we are going to create this!

First, we will need to add in our custom types for `BalanceOf` and `AccountOf` before we declare our
struct. Replace ACTION #1 with the following snippet:

```rust
type AccountOf<T> = <T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId;
type BalanceOf<T> =
    <<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;

// Struct for holding Kitty information.
#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, PartialEq)]
pub struct Kitty<T: Config> {
    pub dna: [u8; 16],
    pub price: Option<BalanceOf<T>>,
    pub gender: Gender,
    pub owner: AccountOf<T>,
}
```

<Message type='gray' title='Note' text = {`
We define \`<BalanceOf<T>>\` and \`AccountOf<T>\` types, and use them in the \`Kitty\`. If you
wonder what the first line means in Rust, it is to define a type alias \`AccountOf<T>\` which is
just a shorthand pointing to the associated type \`AccountId\` of trait \`frame_system::Config\`
that generic type \`T\` is required to be bound of.\n\n
More about this type of syntax is covered in [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types).
`}/>

Notice how we use the derive macro to include [various helper traits][prelude-traits-rustdocs] for
using our struct. For type `Gender`, we will need to build out our own custom enum and helper
functions. Now is a good time to do that.

### Write a Custom Type For `Gender`

We have just created a struct that requires a custom type called `Gender`. This type will handle an
enum defining our Kitty's gender. To create it, you'll build out the following parts:

- **An enum declaration**, which specifies `Male` and `Female` values.
- **A function to configure a defaut value**, based on the enum.

#### A. Enums

Replace ACTION item #2 with the following enum declaration:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Gender {
    Male,
    Female,
}
```

Notice the use of the [derive macro][derive-macro-rust] which must precede the enum declaration.
This wraps our enum in the data structures it will need to interface with other types in our
runtime.

Great, we now know how to create a custom struct and specify its default value. But what about
providing a way for a Kitty struct to be _assigned_ a gender value? For that we need to learn one
more thing.

#### B. Configuring Functions For Our Kitty Struct

Configuring a struct is useful in order to pre-define a value in our struct. For example, when
setting a value in relation to what another function returns. In our case we have a similar
situation where we need to configure our Kitty struct in such a way that sets `Gender` according to
a Kitty's DNA.

We'll only be using this function when we get to [creating Kitties](#write-the-create_kitty-dispatchable).
Regardless, let us learn how to write it now and get it out of the way. We'll create a public
function called `gen_gender` that returns the `Gender` type and uses a random function to choose
between `Gender` enum values.

Replace ACTION #4 with the following code snippet:

```rust
fn gen_gender() -> Gender {
    let random = T::KittyRandomness::random(&b"gender"[..]).0;
    match random.as_ref()[0] % 2 {
        0 => Gender::Male,
        _ => Gender::Female,
    }
}
```

Now whenever `gen_gender()` is called inside our pallet, it will return a pseudo random enum value
for `Gender`.

### Implement On-chain Randomness

If we want to be able to tell these Kitties apart, we need to start giving them unique properties!
In the previous step, we've made use of `KittyRandomness` which we haven't actually defined yet.
Let's get to it.

We'll be using the [Randomness trait][randomness-rustdocs] from `frame_support` to do this. It will
be able to generate a random seed which we'll create unique Kitties with as well as breed new
ones.

In order to use the `Randomness` trait for our pallet, we must:

**A. Define a new type bound by `Randomness` trait in our pallet's configuration trait.**

The `Randomness` trait from `frame_support` requires specifying it with a paramater to replace the
`Output` and `BlockNumber` generics. Take a look at [the documentation][randomness-rustdocs] and
the source code implementation to understand how this works. For our purposes, we want the output
of functions using this trait to be [`H256`][h256-rustdocs] which you'll notice should already be
declared at the top of your working codebase.

Replace the ACTION #5 line with:

```rust
type KittyRandomness: Randomness<Self::H256, Self::BlockNumber>;
```

**B. Specify the actual type in our runtime.**

Given that we have added a new type in the configuration of our pallet, we need to config our
runtime to set its concrete type. This could come in handy if ever we want to change the algorithm
that `KittyRandomness` is using, without needing to modify where it's used inside our pallet.

To showcase this point, we're going to set the `KittyRandomness` type to an instance of
[FRAME's `RandomnessCollectiveFlip`][randomness-collective-flip-frame]. Conveniently, the Node
Template already has an instance of the `RandomnessCollectiveFlip` pallet. All you need to do
is **set the `KittyRandomness` type in your runtime, inside `runtime/src/lib.rs`**:

```rust
impl pallet_mykitties::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
  type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip; // <-- ACTION: add this line.
}
```

Programming is about abstraction. Here we have abstracted out the randomness generation
implementation (`RandomnessCollectiveFlip`) from its interface (
`Randomness<Self::H256, Self::BlockNumber>` trait).

#### Generating Random DNA

Generating DNA is similar to using randomness to randomly assign a gender type. The difference is
that we'll be making use of `blake2_128` we imported in the previous part. Replace the ACTION #7
line with:

```rust
fn gen_dna() -> [u8; 16] {
    let payload = (
        T::KittyRandomness::random(&b"dna"[..]).0,
        <frame_system::Pallet<T>>::block_number(),
    );
    payload.using_encoded(blake2_128)
}
```

### Write Remaining Storage Items

#### A. Understanding Storage Item Logics

To easily track all of our kitties, we're going to standardize our logic to use a unique ID as the
global key for our storage items. This means that a single unique key will point to our Kitty
object (i.e. the struct we previously declared).

In order for this to work, we need to make sure that the ID for a new Kitty is always unique. We can
do this with a new storage item `Kitties` which will be a mapping from an ID (Hash) to the Kitty
object.

With this object, we can easily check for collisions by simply checking whether this storage item
already contains a mapping using a particular ID. For example, from inside a dispatchable function
we could check using:

```rust
ensure!(!<Kitties<T>>::exists(new_id), "This new id already exists");
```

Our runtime needs to be made aware of:

1. Unique assets, like currency or Kitties (this will be held by a storgae map called `Kitties`)
2. Ownership of those assets, like account IDs (this will be handled a new storage map called
`KittiesOwned`)

#### B. Using a `StorageMap`

To create a storage instance for the `Kitty` struct, we'll be using[`StorageMap`][storage-map-kb]
&mdash; a hash-map provided to us by FRAME.

Here's what the `Kitties` storage item looks like:

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn kitty)]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<
  _,
  Twox64Concat,
  T::Hash,
  Kitty<T>
  >;
```

Breaking it down, we declare the storage type and assign a `StorageMap` that takes:

- The [`Twox64Concat`][2x64-rustdocs] hashing algorithm.
- A key of type `T::Hash`.
- A value of type `Kitty<T>`.

The `KittiesOwned` storage item is similar except that we'll be using a `BoundedVec` to keep track
of some maximum number of Kitties we'll configure in `runtime/src/lib.s`.

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn kitties_owned)]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<
  _,
  Twox64Concat,
  T::AccountId,
  BoundedVec<T::Hash, T::MaxKittyOwned>,
  ValueQuery
  >;
```

Your turn! Copy the two code snippets above to replace line ACTION #8.

Before we can check our pallet compiles, we need to add a new type `MaxKittyOwned` in the config
trait, which is a pallet constant type (similar to `KittyRandomness` in the previous steps).
Replace ACTION #9 with:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
  //...
  #[pallet::constant]
  type MaxKittyOwned: Get<u32>;
}
```
Finally, we define `MaxKittyOwned` type in `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
parameter_types! {              // <- add this macro
  // One can own at most 9,999 Kitties
  pub const MaxKittyOwned: u32 = 9999;
  }

/// Configure the pallet-kitties in pallets/kitties.
impl pallet_kitties::Config for Runtime {
  type Event = Event;
  type Currency = Balances;
  type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
  type MaxKittyOwned = MaxKittyOwned; // <- add this line
}
```

Assuming you've followed the above steps correctly, now is a good time to check that your pallet compiles:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-kitties
```

## Dispatchables, Events, and Errors

<Message type='yellow' title='Learning Outcome' text={`
- Create a dispatchable function that mints a new Kitty
- Create a helper function to handle storage updates
- Implement Errors and Events
`}/>

In the previous section of this tutorial, we laid down the foundations geared to manage the
ownership of our Kitties &mdash; even though they don't really exist yet! In this part of the
tutorial, we'll be putting these foundations to use by giving our pallet the ability to create a
Kitty using the storage items we declared in the previous part. Breaking things down a little, we're
going to:

- **Write `create_kitty`**: a dispatchable or publicly callable function allowing an account to mint
  a Kitty.
- **Write `mint()`**: a helper function that updates our pallet's storage items and performs error
  checks, called by `create_kitty`.
- **Include `Events`**: using FRAME's `#[pallet::event]` macro.

At the end of this part, we'll check that everything compiles without error and call our
`create_kitty` extrinsic using the PolkadotJS Apps UI.

  `}
/>

### Public and Private Functions

Before we dive right in, it's important to understand the pallet design decisions we'll be making
around coding up our Kitty pallet's minting and ownership management capabilities.

As developers, we want to make sure the code we write is efficient and elegant. Often times,
optimizing for one optimizes for the other. The way we're going to set up our pallet to optimize
for both will be to break-up the "heavy lifting" logics into private helper functions. This improves
code readability and reusability too. As we'll see, we can create private functions which can be
called by multiple dispatchable functions without compromizing on security. In fact, building this
way can be considered an additive security feauture.

<Message
  type={`green`}
  title={`Further Learning`}
  text={`
Check out [this how-to guide](/how-to-guides/v3/basics/helper-functions) about writing and using helper
functions to learn more.
  `}/>

Before jumping into implementing this approach, let's first paint the big picture of what combining
dispatchables and helper functions looks like:

**`create_kitty`** (dispatchable function)

- check the origin is signed
- generate a random hash with the signing account
- create a new Kitty object using the random hash
- call a private `mint()` function

**`mint`** (private helper function)

- check that the Kitty doesn't already exist
- update storage with the new Kitty ID (for all Kitties and for the owner's account)
- update the new total Kitty count for storage and the new owner's account
- deposit an Event to signal that a Kitty has succesfully been created

### Write the `create_kitty` Dispatchable

A [dispatchable][dispatchable-kb] in FRAME always follows the same structure. All pallet
dispatchables live under the `#[pallet::call]` macro which requires declaring the dispatchables
section with ` impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {}`. Read the [documentation][frame-macros-kb] on these
FRAME macros to learn how they work. All we need to know here is that they're a useful feature of
FRAME that minimizes the code required to write for pallets to be properly integrated in a
Substrate chain's runtime.

#### Weights

As per the requirement for `#[pallet::call]` described in the its documentation, every dispatchable
function must have an associated weight to it. Weights are an important part of developing with
Substrate as they provide safe-guards around the amount of computation to fit in a block at
execution time.

[Substrate's weighting system][weights-kb] forces developers to think about the computational
complexity each [extrinsic][extrinsics-kb] carries before it is called so that a node will account
for it's worst case, avoiding lagging the network with extrinsics that may take longer than the
specified block time. Weights are also intimately linked to the [fee system][txn-fees-kb] for a
signed extrinsic.

For this simple application, we're going to default all weights to 100.

Find ACTION #1 and replace it with the following code (we'll be compling it in the following
section):

```rust
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    let kitty_id = Self::mint(&sender, None, None)?;

    // Logging to the console
    log::info!("A kitty is born with ID: {:?}.", kitty_id);
}
```

<Message
  type='gray'
  title='Why "DispatchResult" and not "DispatchResultWithPostInfo"?'
  text={`
In \`create_kitty\` our return was of type \`DispatchResult\`. Since \`mint()\` is a helper for
\`create_kitty\`, we don't need to overwrite \`PostDispatchInfo\`, we can use a return type of
[\`DispatchResult\`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/dispatch/type.DispatchResult.html)
&mdash; its unaugmented version.
  `}/>

### Write the `mint()` Function

As seen when we wrote `create_kitty` in the previous section, we'll need to create `mint()` for
writing our new unique Kitty object to the various storage items declared in Part II of this
tutorial.

Let's get right to it. Our `mint()` function will take the following arguments:

- **`owner`**: of type `&T::AccountId` - this indicates whom the kitty belongs to.
- **`dna`**: of type `Option<[u8; 16]>` - this specifies the DNA of the kitty going to be minted.
  If `None` is passed in, a random DNA will be generated.
- **`gender`**: of type `Option<Gender>` - ditto.

And it will return `Result<T::Hash, Error<T>>`.

Paste in the following code snippet to write the `mint` function, replacing ACTION #2 in the working
codebase:

```rust
// Helper to mint a Kitty.
pub fn mint(
  owner: &T::AccountId,
  dna: Option<[u8; 16]>,
  gender: Option<Gender>,
) -> Result<T::Hash, Error<T>> {
  let kitty = Kitty::<T> {
    dna: dna.unwrap_or_else(Self::gen_dna),
    price: None,
    gender: gender.unwrap_or_else(Self::gen_gender),
    owner: owner.clone(),
  };

  let kitty_id = T::Hashing::hash_of(&kitty);

  // Performs this operation first as it may fail
  let new_cnt = Self::kitty_cnt().checked_add(1)
    .ok_or(<Error<T>>::KittyCntOverflow)?;

  // Performs this operation first because as it may fail
  <KittiesOwned<T>>::try_mutate(&owner, |kitty_vec| {
    kitty_vec.try_push(kitty_id)
  }).map_err(|_| <Error<T>>::ExceedMaxKittyOwned)?;

  <Kitties<T>>::insert(kitty_id, kitty);
  <KittyCnt<T>>::put(new_cnt);
  Ok(kitty_id)
}
```

Let's go over what the above code is doing.

The first thing we're doing is creating a new Kitty object. Then, we create a unique `kitty_id`
using a hashing funciton based on the current properties of the kitty.

Next, we increment the `KittyCnt` using the storage getter function `Self::kitty_cnt()`. We also
checking for overflow with `check_add()` function.

Once we've done with the check, we proceed with updating our storage items by:

1. Making use of the [`try_mutate`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageMap.html#tymethod.try_mutate)
to update the kitty's owner vector.
2. Using [`insert`][insert-rustdocs] method provided by Substrate's StorageMap API to store the
actually Kitty object and associate it with its `kitty_id`.
3. Using [`put`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageValue.html#tymethod.put)
provided by StorageValue API to save the latest kitty count.

<Message type='gray' title='Note' text={`
A quick recap of our storage items\n\n
- **\`<Kitties<T>>\`**: Stores a Kitty's unique traits and price, by storing the Kitty object and
  associating it with its Kitty ID.
- **\`<KittyOwned<T>>\`**: Keeps track of what accounts own what Kitties.
- **\`<KittyCnt<T>>\`**: A count of all Kitties in existence.
`}/>

### Implement Pallet Events

Our pallet can also emit [Events][events-kb] at the end of the function. This not only reports the
success of a function's execution, but also tells the "off-chain world" that some particular state
transition has happened.

FRAME helps us easily manage and declare our pallet's events using the [`#[pallet::event]`][events-rustdocs]
macro. With FRAME macros, events are just an enum declared like this:

```rust
#[pallet::event]
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
pub enum Event<T: Config>{
    /// A function succeeded. [time, day]
    Success(T::Time, T::Day),
}
```

As you can see in the above snippet, we use attribute macro:

`#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]`

This allows us to deposit a specifc event using the pattern below:

```rust
Self::deposit_event(Event::Success(var_time, var_day));
```

In order to use events inside our pallet, we need to add a new associated type `Event` inside our
pallet's configuration trait `Config`. Additionally &mdash; just as when adding any type to our
pallet's `Config` trait &mdash; we also need to define it in our runtime `/runtime/src/lib.rs`.

This pattern is the same as when we added the `KittyRandomness` type in
[Part II of this tutorial](#implement-on-chain-randomness) and has already been included from the
initial scaffolding of our codebase:

```rust
  /// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types it depends on.
  #[pallet::config]
  pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
      /// Because this pallet emits events, it depends on the runtime's definition of an event.
      type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;
      //--snip--//
  }
```

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`
Notice that each event deposit is meant to be informative which is why it carries the various types
associated with it.\n
It's good practice to get in the habit of documenting your event declarations so that your code is
easy to read. It is convention to document events as such:\n
\`/// Description. [types]\`
Learn more about events [here](/v3/runtime/events-and-errors).
  `}/>

Declare your pallet events by replacing the ACTION #3 line with:

```rust
  /// A new Kitty was sucessfully created. \[sender, kitty_id\]
  Created(T::AccountId, T::Hash),
  /// Kitty price was sucessfully set. \[sender, kitty_id, new_price\]
  PriceSet(T::AccountId, T::Hash, Option<BalanceOf<T>>),
  /// A Kitty was sucessfully transferred. \[from, to, kitty_id\]
  Transferred(T::AccountId, T::AccountId, T::Hash),
  /// A Kitty was sucessfully bought. \[buyer, seller, kitty_id, bid_price\]
  Bought(T::AccountId, T::AccountId, T::Hash, BalanceOf<T>),
```

We'll be using most of these events in Part IV of this tutorial. For now let's use the relevant
event for our `create_kitty` dispatchable.

Complete it by replacing ACTION #4 with:

```rust
Self::deposit_event(Event::Created(to, kitty_id));
```

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Note`}
  text={`
If you're building your codebase from the previous part (and haven't been using the helper file
for this part) you'll need to add \`Ok(())\` and properly close the \`create_kitty\` dispatchable.
  `}/>

### Error Handling

FRAME provides us with an error handling system using [`[#pallet::errors]`][errors-kb] which allows
us to specify errors for our pallet and use them across our pallet's functions.

Declare all possible errors using the provided FRAME macro under `#[pallet::error]`, replace line
ACTION #5a with:

```rust
    /// Handles arithemtic overflow when incrementing the Kitty counter.
    KittyCntOverflow,
    /// An account cannot own more Kitties than `MaxKittyCount`.
    ExceedMaxKittyOwned,
    /// Buyer cannot be the owner.
    BuyerIsKittyOwner,
    /// Cannot transfer a kitty to its owner.
    TransferToSelf,
    /// Handles checking whether the Kitty exists.
    KittyNotExist,
    /// Handles checking that the Kitty is owned by the account transferring, buying or setting a price for it.
    NotKittyOwner,
    /// Ensures the Kitty is for sale.
    KittyNotForSale,
    /// Ensures that the buying price is greater than the asking price.
    KittyBidPriceTooLow,
    /// Ensures that an account has enough funds to purchase a Kitty.
    NotEnoughBalance,
```

We'll be using these errors once we write the interactive functions in the next section. Notice
that we've already used `KittyCntOverflow` and `ExceedMaxKittyOwned` in our `mint` function.

Now's a good time to see if your chain can compile. Instead of only checking if your pallet
compiles, run the following command to see if everything can build:

```rust
cargo build --release
```
<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`

  `}/>

Did that build fine? Congratulations! That's the core functionality of our Kitties pallet. In the
next step you'll be able to see everything you've built so far in action.

### Testing with Polkadot-JS Apps UI

Assuming that you successfully built your chain, let's run it and use the [PolkadotJS Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
to interact with it.

In your chain's project directory, run:

```bash
./target/release/node-kitties --tmp --dev
```

By doing this, we're specifying to run a temporary chain in developer mode, so as not to need to
purge storage each time we want to start a fresh chain.

Assuming that blocks are being finalized (which you should be able to see from your terminal in
which you ran the above command), head over to [Polkadot.js Apps UI][polkadotjsapps].

**Follow these steps:**

1. Check that you're connected to the Local Node. Click on the top left circular network icon, open
the "Development" section, and choose "Local Node". Your node is default to be `127.0.0.1.:9944`.

2. Tell the Apps about your custom types. This requires you to navigate to the "_Settings_" ->
"_Developer_" section, and then paste in the editor the following custom types (in JSON format):

  ```json
  {
    "Gender": {
      "_enum": [ "Male", "Female"]
    },
    "Kitty": {
      "dna": "[u8; 16]",
      "price": "Option<Balance>",
      "gender": "Gender",
      "ownder": "AccountId"
    }
  }
  ```

  > The reason we need this is because Polkadot-JS Apps isn't designed to read custom types by default.
  By adding them, it can properly decode each of our storage items that rely on custom types. Add this
  in a file called `types.json` in your projects `runtime` folder.

3. Now go to: _"Developer"_ -> _"Extrinsics"_ and submit a signed extrinsic using _substrateKitties_
by calling the `createKitty()` dispatchable. Make 3 different transactions from Alice, Bob and
Charlie's accounts.

4. Check for the associated event _"Created"_ by going to "_Network_" -> "_Explorer_". You should
be able to see the events emitted and query their block details.

5. Check your newly created Kitty's details by going to "_Developer_" -> "_Chain State_". Select
the _substrateKitties_ pallet and query `Kitties(Hash): Kitty`. **Note:** You'll notice that this
is actually querying all of your pallet's storage items!

Be sure to uncheck the "include option" box and you should be able to see the details of your newly
minted Kitty in the following format:

```json
kitties.kitties: Option<Kitty>
[
  [
    [
      0x15cb95604033af239640125a30c45b671a282f3ef42c6fc48a78eb18464b30a9
    ],
    {
      dna: 0xaf2f2b3f77e110a56933903a38cde1eb,
      price: null,
      gender: Female,
      ownder: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
    }
  ]
]
```

6. Check that other storage items correctly reflect the creation of additional Kitties.

## Interacting with your Kitties

<Message type='yellow' title='Learning Outcome' text={`
- Create a dispatchable to buy a Kitty
- Create a dispatchable to transfer a Kitty
- Create a dispatchable to breed two Kitties
`}/>

Up until this point in the tutorial, we've built a chain capable of only creating and tracking the
ownership of Kitties. In this part of the tutorial, we want to make our runtime more like a game by
introducing other functions like buying and selling of Kitties. In order to achieve this, we'll
first need to enable users to mark and update the price of their Kitties. Then we can add
functionality to enable users to transfer, buy, and breed Kitties.

### Set a Price For Each Kitty

In [the helper file for this part of the tutorial](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-how-to-guides/blob/main/static/code/kitties-tutorial/04-interacting-functions.rs),
you'll notice that the structure of `set_price` is already laid out.

Your job is to replace ACTION lines #1, #2 and #3 lines with what you'll learn in sections A-D
below.

#### A. Checking Kitty Owner

As we create functions which modify objects in storage, we should always check first that only the
appropriate users can successfully execute the logics in these dispatchable functions.

The general pattern for an ownership check will look something like this:

```rust
let owner = Self::owner_of(object_id).ok_or("No owner for this object")?;

ensure!(owner == sender, "You are not the owner");
```

The first line checks if `Self::owner_of(object_id)` return a `Some(val)`. If yes, it is
transformed into `Result::Ok(val)`, and finally extract `val` out from `Result`. If not, it is
transformed into `Result::Err()` with provided error message, and return early with the error
object.

The second line checks if `owner == sender`. If true, the program execution continues to the next
line. If not, `Result::Err("You are not the owner")` error object is immediately returned from the
function.

**Your turn!**

Paste in this code snippet to replace ACTION #1:

```rust
ensure!(Self::is_kitty_owner(&kitty_id, &sender)?, <Error<T>>::NotKittyOwner);
```

Paste the following in ACTION #1a:

```rust
pub fn is_kitty_owner(kitty_id: &T::Hash, acct: &T::AccountId) -> Result<bool, Error<T>> {
    match Self::kitties(kitty_id) {
        Some(kitty) => Ok(kitty.owner == *acct),
        None => Err(<Error<T>>::KittyNotExist)
    }
}
```

The line pasted in ACTION #1 is actually combining two checks together. In case
`Self::is_kitty_owner()` returns an error object `Err(<Error<T>>::KittyNotExist)`, it is returned
early with `<Error<T>>::KittyNotExist` by the `?`. If it returns `Ok(bool_val)`, the `bool_val`
is extracted, and if false, returns `<Error<T>>::NotKittyOwner` error.

#### B. Updating the price of our Kitty object

Every Kitty object has a price attribute that we've set to `None` as a default value inside the
`mint` function in [Part II](#write-the-mint-function):

```rust
let kitty = Kitty::<T> {
  dna: dna.unwrap_or_else(Self::gen_dna),
  price: None,                           //<-- 👀 here
  gender: gender.unwrap_or_else(Self::gen_gender),
  owner: owner.clone(),
};
```

To update the price of a Kitty, we'll need to:

- Get the Kitty object in storage.
- Update the object with the new price.
- Save it back into storage.

Changing a value in an existing object in storage would be written in the following way:

```rust
let mut object = Self::get_object(object_id);
object.value = new_value;

<Object<T>>::insert(object_id, object);
```

<Message type='yellow' title='Note' text={`
Rust expects you to declare a variable as mutable (using the \`mut\` keyword) whenever its value is
going to be updated.
`}/>

**Your turn!**

Paste in the following snippet to replace the ACTION #2 line:

```rust
kitty.price = new_price.clone();
<Kitties<T>>::insert(&kitty_id, kitty);
```

#### D. Deposit an Event

Once all checks are passed and the new price is written to storage, we can deposit an event
[just like we did in Part III](#implement-pallet-events).
Replace the line marked as ACTION #3 with:

```rust
Self::deposit_event(Event::PriceSet(sender, kitty_id, new_price));
```

Now whenever the `set_price` dispatchable is called successfully, it will emit a `PriceSet` event.
🎉

### Transfer a Kitty

You already have the tools and knowledge you'll need to create the transfer functionality from
[step 1](#1-set-a-price-for-each-kitty). The main difference is that there are **two parts** to
achieving this:

1. A **dispatchable function** called `transfer()`: this is a publicly callable dispatchable exposed
by your pallet.
2. A **private function** called `transfer_kitty_to()`: this will be a private helper function
called by `transfer()` to handle all storage updates when transferring a Kitty.

Separating the logic this way makes the private `transfer_kitty_to()` function reusable by other
dispatchable functions of our pallet without needing to duplicate code. In our case, we're going to
reuse it for the `buy_kitty` dispatchable we're creating in the next section.

#### `transfer`

Paste in the following snippet to replace ACTION #5 in the template code:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(100)]
pub fn transfer(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    to: T::AccountId,
    kitty_id: T::Hash
) -> DispatchResult {
    let from = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Ensure the kitty exists and is called by the kitty owner
    ensure!(Self::is_kitty_owner(&kitty_id, &from)?, <Error<T>>::NotKittyOwner);

    // Verify the kitty is not transferring back to its owner.
    ensure!(from != to, <Error<T>>::TransferToSelf);

    // Verify the recipient has the capacity to receive one more kitty
    let to_owned = <KittiesOwned<T>>::get(&to);
    ensure!((to_owned.len() as u32) < T::MaxKittyOwned::get(), <Error<T>>::ExceedMaxKittyOwned);

    Self::transfer_kitty_to(&kitty_id, &to)?;

    Self::deposit_event(Event::Transferred(from, to, kitty_id));

    Ok(())
}
```

By now the above pattern should be familiar. We always check that the transaction is signed; then
we verify that:

1. The Kitty being transferred is owned by the sender of this transaction;
2. The Kitty is not transferred to its owner (a redundant operation);
3. The recipient has the capacity to receive one more kitty;

Lastly we call the `transfer_kitty_to` helper to update all storage items appropriately.

#### `transfer_kitty_to`

Now, the `transfer_kitty_to` function will be a helper to perform all storage updates once a Kitty
is transferred (and it is going to be called when a kitty is bought and sold too). All it needs to
do is perform safety checks and update the following storage items:

- `KittiesOwned`: to update the owner of the Kitty.
- `Kitties`: to reset the price in the Kitty object to `None`.

Copy the following to replace ACTION #6:

```rust
#[transactional]
pub fn transfer_kitty_to(
    kitty_id: &T::Hash,
    to: &T::AccountId,
) -> Result<(), Error<T>> {
    let mut kitty = Self::kitties(&kitty_id).ok_or(<Error<T>>::KittyNotExist)?;

    let prev_owner = kitty.owner.clone();

    // Remove `kitty_id` from the KittyOwned vector of `prev_kitty_owner`
    <KittiesOwned<T>>::try_mutate(&prev_owner, |owned| {
        if let Some(ind) = owned.iter().position(|&id| id == *kitty_id) {
            owned.swap_remove(ind);
            return Ok(());
        }
        Err(())
    }).map_err(|_| <Error<T>>::KittyNotExist)?;

    // Update the kitty owner
    kitty.owner = to.clone();
    // Reset the ask price so the kitty is not for sale until `set_price()` is called
    // by the current owner.
    kitty.price = None;

    <Kitties<T>>::insert(kitty_id, kitty);

    <KittiesOwned<T>>::try_mutate(to, |vec| {
        vec.try_push(*kitty_id)
    }).map_err(|_| <Error<T>>::ExceedMaxKittyOwned)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Notice the use of [`[#transactional]`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/attr.transactional.html)
which we imported at the very beginning of this tutorial. It allows us to write dispatchable
functions that commit changes to the storage only if the annotated function return `Ok`. Otherwise
all changes are discarded.

### Buy a Kitty

#### A. Check a Kitty is for Sale

We'll need to ensure two things before we can allow the user of this function to purchase a Kitty:

1. Check that the Kitty is for sale;
2. Check whether the Kitty's current price is within the user's budget and whether the user has
enough free balance.

Replace line ACTION #7:

```rust
// Check the kitty is for sale and the kitty ask price <= bid_price
if let Some(ask_price) = kitty.price {
    ensure!(ask_price <= bid_price, <Error<T>>::KittyBidPriceTooLow);
} else {
    Err(<Error<T>>::KittyNotForSale)?;
}

// Check the buyer has enough free balance
ensure!(T::Currency::free_balance(&buyer) >= bid_price, <Error<T>>::NotEnoughBalance);
```

In a similar vain, we have to verify whether the user has the capacity to receive a Kitty &mdash;
remember we're using a [`BoundedVec`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/storage/bounded_vec/struct.BoundedVec.html)
that can only hold a fixed number of Kitties, defined in our pallet's `MaxKittyOwned` constant.

```rust
// Verify the buyer has the capacity to receive one more kitty
let to_owned = <KittiesOwned<T>>::get(&buyer);
ensure!((to_owned.len() as u32) < T::MaxKittyOwned::get(), <Error<T>>::ExceedMaxKittyOwned);

let seller = kitty.owner.clone();
```

#### B. Making a Payment

In [Step 2](#2-transfer-a-kitty), we added the functions necessary to transfer the _ownership_ of our
Kitties. But we haven't yet touched on the currrency associated to our pallet.

In this step we'll learn how to use [FRAME's Currency trait][currency-frame-rustdocs] to adjust
account balances using its very own [`transfer` method][transfer-currency-rustdocs]. It's useful to
understand why it's important to use the `transfer` method in particular and how we'll be accessing
it:

- The reason we'll be using it is to ensure our runtime has the same understanding of currency throughout the pallets it interacts with. The way that we ensure this is to use the `Currency` trait
from `frame_support`.

- Conveniently, it handles a [`Balance`][currency-balances-rustdocs] type, making it compatible with
`BalanceOf` type we created for `kitty.price`. Take a look at how the `transfer` function we'll be
using is structured (from the [Rust docs][currency-transfer-rustdocs]):

```rust
fn transfer(
    source: &AccountId,
    dest: &AccountId,
    value: Self::Balance,
    existence_requirement: ExistenceRequirement
) -> DispatchResult
```

Now we can make use of the `Currency` type in our pallet's `Config` trait and `ExistenceRequirement`
&ndash; that we [initially started with in Part I](#write-out-pallet_kitties-scaffold).

Update the balances of both the caller of this function and the receiver, replacing ACTION #8:

```rust
// Transfer the amount from buyer to seller
T::Currency::transfer(&buyer, &seller, bid_price, ExistenceRequirement::KeepAlive)?;

// Transfer the kitty from seller to buyer
Self::transfer_kitty_to(&kitty_id, &buyer)?;

// Deposit relevant Event
Self::deposit_event(Event::Bought(buyer, seller, kitty_id, bid_price));
```

<Message type='yellow' title='Note' text={`
Both of the above operations, \`T::Currency::transfer()\`, and \`Self::transfer_kitty_to()\` COULD
fail. We check for the returned result in each cases. If \`Err\` is returned, we also return from the
function immediately. In order to keep the storage consistent, we also annotate this function as
\`#[transactional]\`.
`}/>

### Breed Kitties

The logic behind breeding two Kitties is to multiply each corresponding DNA segment from two Kitties,
which will produce a new DNA sequence. Then, that DNA is used when minting a new Kitty. This helper
function is already provided for you in the template file for this section.

Paste in the following to complete the `breed_kitty` function, replacing line ACTION #10:

```rust
let new_dna = Self::breed_dna(&kid1, &kid2)?;
```

Now that we've used the user inputs of Kitty IDs and combined them to create a new unique Kitty ID,
we can use the `mint()` function to write that new Kitty to storage. Replace line ACTION #11:

```rust
Self::mint(&sender, Some(new_dna), None)?;
```

### Genesis configuration

The final step before our pallet is ready to be used is to set the genesis state of our storage
items. We'll make use of FRAME's `[pallet::genesis_config]` to do this. Essentially, we're declaring
what the Kitties object in storage contains in the genesis block. Copy the following code to
replace ACTION #12:

```rust
// Our pallet's genesis configuration.
#[pallet::genesis_config]
pub struct GenesisConfig<T: Config> {
    pub kitties: Vec<(T::AccountId, [u8; 16], Gender)>,
}

// Required to implement default for GenesisConfig.
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
impl<T: Config> Default for GenesisConfig<T> {
    fn default() -> GenesisConfig<T> {
        GenesisConfig { kitties: vec![] }
    }
}

#[pallet::genesis_build]
impl<T: Config> GenesisBuild<T> for GenesisConfig<T> {
    fn build(&self) {
        // When building a kitty from genesis config, we require the dna and gender to be supplied.
        for (acct, dna, gender) in &self.kitties {
            let _ = <Pallet<T>>::mint(acct, Some(dna.clone()), Some(gender.clone()));
        }
    }
}
```

To let our chain know about our pallet's genesis configuration, we need to modify the
`chain_spec.rs` file in our project's `node` folder. Go to `/node/src/chain_spec.rs` and add the
following inside the `testnet_genesis` function:

```rust
//-- snip
    kitties: KittiesConfig {
      kitties: vec![],
    },
//-- snip
```
### Update `runtime/src/lib.rs` And Interact With Your Kitties

If you've completed all of the preceding parts and steps of this tutorial, you're all geared up to
run your chain and start interacting with all the new capabilities of your Kitties pallet.

Build and run your chain using the following commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/node-kitties --dev --tmp
```

Now check your work using the Polkadot-JS Apps just like [we did in the previous part](#testing-with-polkadot-js-apps-ui).
Once your chain is running and connected to the PolkadotJS Apps UI, perform these manual checks:

- Fund multiple users with tokens so they can all participate
- Have each user create multiple Kitties
- Try to transfer a Kitty from one user to another using the right and wrong owner
- Try to set the price of a Kitty using the right and wrong owner
- Buy a Kitty using an owner and another user
- Use too little funds to purchase a Kitty
- Overspend on the cost of the Kitty and ensure that the balance is reduced appropriately
- Breed a Kitty and check that the new DNA is a mix of the old and new

After all of these actions, confirm that all users have the right number of Kitties, the total
Kitty count is correct, and any other storage variables are correctly represented.

<Message type='green' title='Congratulations!' text={`
You've successfully created the backend of a fully functional Substrate chain capable of creating
and managing Substrate Kitties. It could also be abstracted to other NFT-like use cases. Most
importantly, at this point in the tutorial you should have all the knowledge you need to start
creating your own pallet logics and dispatchable functions.
