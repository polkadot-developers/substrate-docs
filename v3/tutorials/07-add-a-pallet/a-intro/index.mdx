## Introduction

The
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
provides a minimal working runtime which you can use to quickly get started building your own custom
blockchain. The Node Template includes [a number of components](/v3/docs/getting-started/architecture), including
a [runtime](/v3/docs/getting-started/glossary#runtime) that is constructed using
[FRAME](/v3/docs/runtime/frame) runtime development framework. However, in order to
remain minimal, it does not include most of the modules (called "pallets") from Substrate's set of
core FRAME pallets.

This guide will show you how you can add the
[Nicks pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/index.html). You can follow
similar patterns to add additional FRAME pallets to your runtime, however you should note that each
pallet is a little different in terms of the specific configuration settings needed to use it
correctly. This tutorial will help you understand what you'll need to consider when adding a new
pallet to your FRAME runtime.

You should already have [latest version of the Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/latest) compiled on your computer from when you completed the
[Create Your First Substrate Chain](/v3/tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/) tutorial. If
you do not, please complete it first.

## What You Will Be Doing

Before we even get started, let's layout what we are going to do over the course of this turorial. We will:

<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '1. Add the Nicks pallet to your Node Template',
    url: '/v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet/import',
  }}

    textLineOne:
      '2. Implement the Nicks pallet configuration trait.',
    url: '/v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet/configure',
  }}
/>
<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '3. Use the Front-end template to interact with the Nicks pallet.',
    url: '/v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet/interact',
  }}
/>
<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '4. Learn how to publish a custom pallet to crates.io.',
    url: '/v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet/publish',
  }}
/>

## Learning outcomes
- Learn how to integrate a FRAME pallet to your node and runtime
- Familiarize yourself with customizing a pallet's configuration trait 
- Learn how to publish a custom pallet to [crates.io](crates.io)
