## Overview

By now you should have successfully imported the Nicks pallet. In future, you will write your own pallets
to execute your application-specific logics. In those cases, you may want to share these pallets
with others.

In this section, we will cover how to publish your own pallet for open source usage.

## Steps 
### 1. Publishing on GitHub

To publish your pallet on GitHub, you need to
[create a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) and
[push your pallet's code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) to it.

Once published, other developers could refer to your pallet in their `Cargo.toml` using the
following snippet:

**`runtime/Cargo.toml`**

```TOML
[dependencies.your-pallet-name]
default_features = false
git = 'https://github.com/your-username/your-pallet'
version = '1.0.0'
branch = 'master'

# You may choose to refer to a specific commit or tag instead of branch
# rev = '<git-commit>'
# tag = '<some tag>
```

### 2. Publishing on crates.io

**crates.io** allows permissionless publishing of any Rust module. You could learn the procedure by
following their guide on how to [publish on crates.io](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html).

Once published, other developers could refer to your pallet in their `Cargo.toml` using the
following snippet:

**`runtime/Cargo.toml`**

```TOML
[dependencies.your-pallet-name]
default_features = false
version = 'some-compatible-version'
```

We do not specify any target destination on the above, and by default it will search for the package
in **crates.io** repository.
