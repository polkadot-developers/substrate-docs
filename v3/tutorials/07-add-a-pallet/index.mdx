As you saw in the [Create your first Substrate blockchain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain) tutorial, the [Substrate node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) provides a working runtime that you can use to start building your own blockchain.
The node template includes a [runtime](/v3/getting-started/glossary#runtime) that is constructed using [FRAME](/v3/runtime/frame) development framework and a few modules—called **pallets**—to get you started.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add the [Nicks pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/index.html) to the node template.
You can follow similar patterns to add other FRAME pallets to your runtime.
However, you need to configure each pallet with the specific settings it requires to use it.
This tutorial illustrates how to configure the settings each pallet requires but not the specific settings that apply to each pallet you decide to add to your runtime.

## Add the Nicks pallet to the node template

The Nicks pallet allows blockchain users to pay a deposit to reserve a nickname and associate it with an account they control.

To add the Nicks pallet to the Substrate node template:

1. Open a terminal shell and change to the root directory for the node template.

1. Open the `runtime/Cargo.toml` configuration file in a text editor.

1. Import the `pallet-nicks` crate to make it available to the node template runtime by adding it to the
   list of dependencies.

   ```toml
   pallet-nicks = { default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.17" }
   ```

In this `dependencies` section, the`default-features = false` setting specifies that the pallet features are not used by default when compiling the runtime.
Instead, the features that are compiled for the runtime are controlled by specifying which features to include when compiling the native Rust binary listed in a separate `features` section.

Because the Substrate runtime compiles to both a native Rust binary with standard library functions [`std`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) and a [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) binary that does not include the standard library, the pallet features that get compiled depend on whether you are compiling the Rust binary (`std` features) or the WebAssembly binary (`no-std`). For more information about compiling [`std`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) and [`no_std`](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/no-std.html) features, see the [Rust Embedded Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html#summary).

   The remaining lines specify that Cargo should use the `pallet-nicks` crate from the `paritytech/substrate` repository with the correct *matching* version of substrate all other crates are using.

   For an introduction to editing `Cargo.toml` files, see the [Cargo reference documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/index.html).

1. Add the `pallet-nicks` crate to the list of `features` to be included in the `std` feature set by adding the following line `features` section.

   ```toml
   [features]
   default = ['std']
   std = [
       ...
       'pallet-aura/std',
       'pallet-balances/std',
       'pallet-nicks/std',
       ...
   ]
   ```

   If you forget to update the `features` section, you might see errors similar to the following when you
   build the native binaries:

   ```
   error[E0425]: cannot find function `memory_teardown` in module `sandbox`
     --> ~/.cargo/git/checkouts/substrate-7e08433d4c370a21/83a6f1a/primitives/sandbox/src/../without_std.rs:53:12
      |
   53 |         sandbox::memory_teardown(self.memory_idx);
      |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in `sandbox`

   error[E0425]: cannot find function `memory_new` in module `sandbox`
     --> ~/.cargo/git/checkouts/substrate-7e08433d4c370a21/83a6f1a/primitives/sandbox/src/../without_std.rs:72:18
      |
   72 |         match sandbox::memory_new(initial, maximum) {
      |
   ...
   ```

1. Check that the new dependencies resolve correctly by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo check -p node-template-runtime
   ```

## Review the configuration trait for the Nicks pallet

Every pallet has a [Rust **trait**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) called `Config` that is used to configure the parameters and types that the pallet needs from the runtime.

If you review the comments for the runtime in the [node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template), you will see examples of using the `Config` configuration trait to define and tune parameters for each pallet.

Most of the pallet-specific code required to add a pallet is implemented using the `Config` trait.
To see what you need to implement for the Nicks pallet specifically, see the [`pallet_nicks::Config` documentation](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/pallet/trait.Config.html) or the definition of the trait itself in [the source code](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/nicks/src/lib.rs) of the Nicks pallet.

In the source code for the `nicks` pallet, the `Config` trait declares the following types:

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
	/// The overarching event type.
	type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;

	/// The currency trait.
	type Currency: ReservableCurrency<Self::AccountId>;

	/// Reservation fee.
	#[pallet::constant]
	type ReservationFee: Get<BalanceOf<Self>>;

	/// What to do with slashed funds.
	type Slashed: OnUnbalanced<NegativeImbalanceOf<Self>>;

	/// The origin which may forcibly set or remove a name. Root can always do this.
	type ForceOrigin: EnsureOrigin<Self::Origin>;

	/// The minimum length a name may be.
	#[pallet::constant]
	type MinLength: Get<u32>;

	/// The maximum length a name may be.
	#[pallet::constant]
	type MaxLength: Get<u32>;
}
```

## Review the implementation of the Balances pallet

Just like you used the Balances pallet as a template for importing the Nicks pallet, you can use the [Balances pallet](/v3/runtime/frame#balances) as an example to see how to implement the `Config` interface for the Nicks pallet.

1. Open the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Locate the Balances pallet section and note that the implementation consists of two parts:

   - The `parameter_types!` block where constant values are defined.

     ```rust
     parameter_types! {
     	// The u128 constant value 500 is aliased to a type named ExistentialDeposit.
     	pub const ExistentialDeposit: u128 = 500;
     	// A heuristic that is used for weight estimation.
     	pub const MaxLocks: u32 = 50;
     }

     ```

   - The `impl` block where the types and values defined by the `Config` interface are configured.

     ```rust
     impl pallet_balances::Config for Runtime {
     	// The previously defined parameter_type is used as a configuration parameter.
     	type MaxLocks = MaxLocks;

     	// The "Balance" that appears after the equal sign is an alias for the u128 type.
     	type Balance = Balance;

     	// The empty value, (), is used to specify a no-op callback function.
     	type DustRemoval = ();

     	// The previously defined parameter_type is used as a configuration parameter.
     	type ExistentialDeposit = ExistentialDeposit;

     	// The FRAME runtime system is used to track the accounts that hold balances.
     	type AccountStore = System;

     	// Weight information is supplied to the Balances pallet by the node template runtime.
     	// type WeightInfo = (); // old way
     	type WeightInfo = pallet_balances::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;

     	// The ubiquitous event type.
     	type Event = Event;
     }
     ```

The `impl pallet_balances::Config` block allows you to configure the types and parameters that are specified by the Balances pallet `Config` trait.
For example, this `impl` block configures the Balances pallet to use the `u128` type to track balances.
If you were developing a chain where it was important to optimize storage, you could use any unsigned integer type that was at least 32-bits in size because the [`Balance` type](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_balances/pallet/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.Balance) for the Balances pallet `Config` trait is bound by the [`AtLeast32BitUnsigned` trait](/rustdocs/latest/sp_arithmetic/traits/trait.AtLeast32BitUnsigned.html).

## Implement the Nicks pallet `Config` trait

Now that you have seen an example of how the `Config` trait is implemented for the Balances pallet, you're ready to implement the `Config` trait for the Nicks pallet.

To implement the nicks pallet in your runtime:

1. Open the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. After the last line of the Balances code block, add the following code block for the Nicks pallet:

   ```rust
   /// Add this code block to your template for Nicks:
   parameter_types! {
   	// Choose a fee that incentivizes desireable behavior.
   	pub const NickReservationFee: u128 = 100;
   	pub const MinNickLength: u32 = 8;
   	// Maximum bounds on storage are important to secure your chain.
   	pub const MaxNickLength: u32 = 32;
   }

   impl pallet_nicks::Config for Runtime {
   	// The Balances pallet implements the ReservableCurrency trait.
   	// `Balances` is defined in `construct_runtime!` macro. See below.
   	// https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/pallet_balances/index.html#implementations-2
   	type Currency = Balances;

   	// Use the NickReservationFee from the parameter_types block.
   	type ReservationFee = NickReservationFee;

   	// No action is taken when deposits are forfeited.
   	type Slashed = ();

   	// Configure the FRAME System Root origin as the Nick pallet admin.
   	// https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/frame_system/enum.RawOrigin.html#variant.Root
   	type ForceOrigin = frame_system::EnsureRoot<AccountId>;

   	// Use the MinNickLength from the parameter_types block.
   	type MinLength = MinNickLength;

   	// Use the MaxNickLength from the parameter_types block.
   	type MaxLength = MaxNickLength;

   	// The ubiquitous event type.
   	type Event = Event;
   }
   ```

1. Identify the types that the Nicks pallet exposes.

   You can find a complete list of types in the
   [`construct_runtime!` macro](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/macro.construct_runtime.html) documentation.

   The [Nicks pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/nicks/src/lib.rs) uses
   the following types:

   - Pallet **Storage**: Because it uses the `#[pallet::storage]` macro.
   - Pallet **Event**s: Because it uses the `#[pallet::events]` macro. You will notice that in the case of
     the Nicks pallet, the `Event` keyword is parameterized with respect to a type, `T`; this is
     because at least one of the events defined by the Nicks pallet depends on a type that is
     configured with the `Config` configuration trait.
   - **Call**able Functions: Because it has dispatchable functions in the `#[pallet::call]` macro.
   - The **Pallet** type from the `#[pallet::pallet]` macro.

1. Add Nicks to the `construct_runtime!` macro.

   For example:

   ```rust
   construct_runtime!(
   	pub enum Runtime where
   	    Block = Block,
   	    NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
   	    UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
   	{
   	    /* --snip-- */
   	    Balances: pallet_balances,

   	    /*** Add This Line ***/
   	    Nicks: pallet_nicks,
   	}
   );
   ```

1. Check that the new dependencies resolve correctly by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo check -p node-template-runtime
   ```

   If there are no errors, you are ready to compile.

1. Compile the node in release mode by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Start the blockchain node and use the Nicks pallet

After your node compiles, you are ready to start the node that has been enhanced with nickname capabilities from the [Nicks pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/index.html) and interact with it using the front-end template.

### Start the local Substrate node

To start the local Substrate node:

1. Open a terminal shell, if necessary.

1. Change to the root directory of the Substrate node template.

1. Start the node in development mode by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/node-template --dev
   ```

   The node-template command-line options specify how you want the running node to operate.
   In this case, the `--dev` option specifies that the node runs in developer mode using the predefined `development` chain specification.
   By default, this option also deletes all active data—such as keys, the blockchain database, and networking information when you stop the node by pressing Control-c.
   Using the `--dev` option ensures that you have a clean working state any time you stop and restart the node.

1. Verify your node is up and running successfully by reviewing the output displayed in the terminal.

   If the number after `finalized` is increasing in the console output, your blockchain is producing new blocks and reaching consensus about the state they describe.

1. Keep the terminal that displays the node output open to continue.

### Start the front-end template

Now that you have added a new pallet to your runtime, you can use the Substrate front-end template to interact with the node template and access the Nicks pallet.

To start the front-end template:

1. Open a new terminal shell on your computer.

1. In the new terminal, change to the root directory where you installed the front-end template.

1. Start the web server for the front-end template by running the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

1. Open http://localhost:8000/ in a browser to view the front-end template.

### Set a nickname using the Nicks pallet

After you start the front-end template, you can use it to interact with the Nicks pallet you just added to the runtime.

To set a nickname for an account:

1. Check the account selection list to verify that the Alice account is currently selected.

1. In the Pallet Interactor component, verify that Extrinsic is selected.

1. Select `nicks` from the list of pallets available to call.

1. Select the [`setName` dispatchable](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.set_name) as the function to call from the `nicks` pallet.

1. Type a name that is longer than the `MinNickLength` (8 characters)and no longer than the `MaxNickLength` (32 characters).

1. Click `Signed` to execute the function.

   ![Set a name](../../../src/images/tutorials/07-add-a-pallet/set-name.png)

1. Observe the status of the call and the [events](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/enum.RawEvent.html) emitted by the Nicks pallet.

### Query information for an account using the Nicks pallet

Next, you can use Query capability to read the value of Alice's nickname from the [runtime storage](/v3/runtime/storage) for the Nicks pallet.

To return the information stored for Alice:

1. In the Pallet Interactor component, select **Query**.

1. Select `nicks` from the list of pallets available to query.

1. Select the [`nameOf`](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.set_name).

1. Copy and paste the address for the alice account in the Account field, then click **Query**.

   ![Read a name](../../../src/images/tutorials/07-add-a-pallet/name-of-alice.png)

   The return type is a tuple that contains two values:

   - The hex-encoded nickname for the Alice account.

   - The amount that was reserved from Alice's account to secure the nickname.

   If you were to query the Nicks pallet for the nameOf for Bob's account, you would see the `None` value returned because Bob has not invoked the `setName` dispatchable and deposited the funds to reserve a nickname.

   ![Read an empty name](../../../src/images/tutorials/07-add-a-pallet/name-of-bob.png)

## Explore more advanced topics

This tutorial uses the `Signed` button to invoke [the `killName` dispatchable](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.kill_name) function and uses Bob's account ID as the function's argument.
The `killName` function must be called by the `ForceOrigin` that was configured with the Nicks pallet's `Config` interface in the previous section.
You may recall that we configured this to be the FRAME system's `Root` origin.
The node template's [chain specification](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/blob/latest/node/src/chain_spec.rs) file is used to configure the [Sudo pallet](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_sudo/index.html) to give Alice access to this origin.

The front-end template makes it easy to use the Sudo pallet to dispatch a call from the `Root` origin - just use the `SUDO` button to invoke the dispatchable.
Since we just used the `Signed` button as opposed to the `SUDO` button, the function was _dispatched_ by [the `Signed` origin](/rustdocs/latest/frame_system/enum.RawOrigin.html#variant.Signed) associated with Alice's account as opposed to the `Root` origin.

![`BadOrigin` Error](../../../src/images/tutorials/07-add-a-pallet/kill-name-bad-origin.png)

You will notice that even though the function call was successfully dispatched, a `BadOrigin` error was emitted and is visible in the Events pane.
This means that Alice's account was still charged [fees](/v3/runtime/weights-and-fees) for the dispatch, but there weren't any state changes executed because the Nicks pallet follows the important [verify-first-write-last](/v3/runtime/storage#verify-first-write-last) pattern.
Now use the `SUDO` button to dispatch the same call with the same parameter.

![Nicks Pallet Error](../../../src/images/tutorials/07-add-a-pallet/clear-name-error.png)

The Sudo pallet emits a [`Sudid` event](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_sudo/pallet/enum.Event.html#variant.Sudid) to inform network participants that the `Root` origin dispatched a call, however, you will notice that the inner dispatch failed with a [`DispatchError`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_runtime/enum.DispatchError.html) (the Sudo pallet's [`sudo` function](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_sudo/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.sudo) is the "outer" dispatch).
In particular, this was an instance of [the `DispatchError::Module` variant](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/dispatch/enum.DispatchError.html#variant.Module), which reports two pieces of metadata: an `index` number and an `error` number.
The `index` number relates to the pallet from which the error originated; it corresponds with the _index_ (position) of the pallet within the `construct_runtime!` macro.
The `error` number corresponds with the index of the relevant variant from that pallet's `Error` enum.
When using these numbers to find pallet errors, remember that the _first_ position corresponds with index _zero_.
In the screenshot above, the `index` is `9` (the _tenth_ pallet) and the `error` is `2` (the _third_ error).
Depending on the position of the Nicks pallet in your `construct_runtime!` macro, you may see a different number for `index`.
Regardless of the value of `index`, you should see that the `error` value is `2`, which corresponds to the _third_ variant of the Nick's pallet's `Error` enum, [the `Unnamed` variant](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_nicks/enum.Error.html#variant.Unnamed).
This shouldn't be a surprise since Bob has not yet reserved a nickname, thus it cannot be cleared!

You should confirm that Alice can use the `SUDO` button to invoke the `killName` dispatchable and forcibly clear the nickname associated with any account (including her own) that actually has a nickname associated with it.
Here are some other things you may want to try:

- Add a nickname that is shorter than the `MinNickLength` or longer than the `MaxNickLength` that you configured with the Nick's pallet's `Config` configuration trait.
- Add a nickname for Bob then use Alice's account and the `SUDO` button to forcibly kill Bob's nickname.
  Switch back to Bob's account and dispatch the `clearName` function.

### Adding other FRAME pallets

This tutorial illustrated how to add a pallet to the runtime using the Nicks pallet as an example.
However, it is important to note that each pallet is a little different.
If you aren't sure how to add a specific pallet, the best place to look is the runtime from the main [Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node/runtime).
Unlike the node template used in tutorials, the runtime in the main Substrate repository includes most of the pallets available in the library of core FRAME pallets.

Refer to the `bin/node/runtime/Cargo.toml` file for the main Substrate node runtime to see examples of how to import different pallet dependencies.
Refer to the `bin/node/runtime/src/lib.rs` file for the main Substrate node runtime to see examples of how to configure the runtime to include each pallet.
Generally, you can copy the code from the main Substrate node runtime as a starting point to include a pallet in your own runtime.

## Publish your own pallet

By now you should have successfully imported the Nicks pallet.
In future, you will write your own pallets to execute your application-specific logic.
In those cases, you may want to share these pallets with others.

In this section, we will cover how to publish your own pallet for open source usage.

### Option 1: Publishing on GitHub

To publish your pallet on GitHub, you need to [create a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) and [push your pallet's code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) to it.

Once published, other developers could refer to your pallet in their `Cargo.toml` using the following snippet:

**`runtime/Cargo.toml`**

```toml
your-pallet-name = { default_features = false, git = "https://github.com/your-username/your-pallet", version = "1.0.0" }

# You may choose to refer to a specific commit, tag, or branch instead of (or in addition to, over-specifying) a version
# rev = "<git-commit>""
# tag = "<some tag>"
# branch = "<some branch>"
```

### Option 2: Publishing on crates.io

**crates.io** allows permissionless publishing of any Rust module.
You could learn the procedure by following their guide on how to [publish on crates.io](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html).

Once published, other developers could refer to your pallet in their `Cargo.toml` using the following snippet:

**`runtime/Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[dependencies]
your-pallet-name = { default_features = false, version = "some-compatible-version"}
```

We do not specify any target destination on the above, and by default it will search for the package in **crates.io** repository.
