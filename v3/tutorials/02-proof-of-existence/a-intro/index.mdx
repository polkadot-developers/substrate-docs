## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn to create a custom
["Proof of Existence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence) dApp using the Substrate
blockchain development framework and the [FRAME](/v3/runtime/frame) library. From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence):

> "Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a
> specific time via timestamped transactions in the bitcoin blockchain."

Rather than uploading the entire file to the blockchain to "prove its existence", users submit a
[hash of the file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification), known as a file digest or
checksum. These hashes are powerful because huge files can be uniquely represented by a small hash
value, which is efficient for storing on the blockchain. Any user with the original file can prove
that this file matches the one on the blockchain by simply recomputing the hash of the file and
comparing it with the hash stored on chain.

To add to this, blockchains also provide a robust identity system through accounts that map to
[public keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), and associations built on
top of those keys (see [FRAME's identity pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v3.0.0/frame/identity)).
So when a file digest is stored on the blockchain, we can also record which account uploaded that digest.
This allows that controller of that account to later prove that they were the original person to claim the file.

This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete. We will be using the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), but you
do not need to know these to be able to complete this guide. We will provide you with working code
snippets and explain what all the code does at a high level.

We only expect that:

- You have completed the
  [Create Your First Substrate Chain Tutorial](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain).
- You are generally familiar with software development, writing code, and running your code.
- You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.
