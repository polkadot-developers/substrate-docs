## Overview

For our PoE blockchain, we'll be customizing the Node Template so you'll need to make sure you have it installed.
We'll also be customizing the Front-end Template so you'll need to make sure you have that too. This part steps you
through just that and goes over our application design.

## Steps
### 1. Install the Node Template

You should already have version `v3.0.0+1` of the
[Substrate Developer Hub Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/tutorials/solutions%2Fbuild-a-dapp-v3+1)
compiled on your computer from when you completed the
[Create Your First Substrate Chain Tutorial](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain). If you do not,
please complete that tutorial. (v3.0.0 tag works as well, but comes with FRAME v1 templates,
v3.0.0+1 includes FRAME v2 templates that you can use for reference for mock and testing files.)

```bash
git clone -b v3.0.0+1 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
```

      "Experienced developers may prefer to skip that tutorial and install the Node Template according to
      the instructions in [its readme](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template#getting-started)."

### 2. Install the Front-End Template

The **Create Your First Substrate Chain** Tutorial used the front-end template, so there is no
additional set-up required if you have already completed that tutorial.

  "Refer directly to the front-end setup instructions for the
  [Create Your First Chain Tutorial](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain/setup#install-the-front-end-template)
  if necessary.

### 3. Application Design

Our PoE API will expose two callable functions:

- `create_claim()` - allows a user to claim the existence of a file by uploading a file digest.
- `revoke_claim()` - allows the current owner of a claim to revoke their ownership.

In order to implement this, we will only need to store information about the proofs that have been
claimed, and who made those claims.

Sounds simple enough, right? Let's get coding!

## Next steps
1. Create a custom pallet from scratch
2. Implement pallet events, errors and storage items 
3. Implement callabe functions `create_claim()` and `revoke_claim()`
