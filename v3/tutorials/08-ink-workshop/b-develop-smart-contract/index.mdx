In [Prepare your first contract](/tutorials/v3/ink-workshop/pt1), you learned the basic steps for building and deploying a smart contract on a Substrate-based blockchain using a default first project.
For this tutorial, you'll develop a new smart contract that increments a counter value each time you execute a function call.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

* You have good internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

* You are generally familiar with software development and using command-line interfaces.

* You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms.

* You have installed Rust and set up your development environment as described in [Installation](/v3/getting-started/installation).

* You have completed [Prepare your first contract](/tutorials/v3/ink-workshop/pt1) and have the Substrate contracts node installed locally.

## Tutorial objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will accomplish the following objectives:

* Learn how to use a smart contract template.

* Store simple values using a smart contract.

* Increment and retrieve stored values using a smart contract.

* Add public and private functions to a smart contract.

## Smart contracts and ink!

In [Prepare your first contract](/tutorials/v3/ink-workshop/pt1), you installed the `cargo-contract` package for command-line access to the ink! programming language.
The ink! language is an [embedded domain specific language](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language).
This language enables you to write WebAssembly-based smart contracts using the Rust programming language.

The language uses standard Rust patterns with specialized `#[ink(...)]` attribute macros. These attribute macros describe what different parts of your smart contract represent so they can be transformed into Substrate-compatible WebAssembly bytecode.

## Create a new smart contract project

Smart contracts that run on Substrate start as projects. 
You create projects using `cargo contract` commands.

For this tutorial, you'll create a new project for the `incrementer` smart contract. 
Creating a new project adds a new project directory and default starter files—also called **template files**—to the project directory.
You will modify these starter template files to build the smart contract logic for the `incrementer` project.

To create a new project for your smart contract:

1. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

1. Create a new project named `incrementer` by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo contract new incrementer
    ```

1. Change to the new project directory by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cd incrementer/
    ```

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.
    
    By default, the template `lib.rs` file contains the source code for the `flipper` smart contract with instances of the `flipper` contract name renamed `incrementer`.

1. Replace the default template source code with new [incrementer](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-contracts-workshop/blob/master/1/assets/1.1-finished-code.rs) source code.

1. Save the changes to the `lib.rs` file, then close the file.

1. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in a text editor and review the dependencies for the contract.

1. In the `[dependencies]` section, modify the `scale` and `scale-info` settings, if necessary.
    
    ```toml
    scale = { package = "parity-scale-codec", version = "3", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
    scale-info = { version = "2", default-features = false, features = ["derive"], optional = true }
    ```

1. Save changes to the `Cargo.toml` file, then close the file.

1. Verify that the program compiles and passes the trivial test by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```

    You can ignore any warnings because this template code is simply a skeleton.
    The command should display output similar to the following to indicate successful test completion:

    ```text
    running 1 test
    test incrementer::tests::default_works ... ok
    
    test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    ```

1. Verify that you can build the WebAssembly for the contract by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly contract build
    ```
    
    If the program compiles successfully, you are ready to start programming.

## Store simple values

Now that you have some starter source code for the `incrementer` smart contract, you can introduce some new functionality.
For example, this smart contract requires storage of simple values.
The following code illustrates how to store simple values for this contract using the `#[ink(storage)]` attribute macro:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyContract {
	// Store a bool
	my_bool: bool,
	// Store a number
	my_number: u32,
}
```

### Supported types

Substrate smart contracts support most Rust common data types, including Booleans, unsigned and signed integers, strings, tuples, and arrays.
These data types are encoded and decoded using the [Parity scale codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-codec) for efficient transmission over the network. 

In addition to common Rust type that can be encoded and decoded using the scale codec, the ink! language supports Substrate-specific types—like `AccountId`, `Balance`, and `Hash`—as if they were primitive types.
The following code illustrates how to store an `AccountId` and `Balance` for this contract:

```rust
// We are importing the default ink! types
use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod MyContract {

	// Our struct will use those default ink! types
	#[ink(storage)]
	pub struct MyContract {
		// Store some AccountId
		my_account: AccountId,
		// Store some Balance
		my_balance: Balance,
	}
	/* --snip-- */
}
```

### Constructors

Every ink! smart contract must have at least one constructor that runs when the contract is created. 
However, a smart contract can have multiple constructors, if needed.
The following code illustrates using multiple constructors:

```rust
use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod mycontract {

	#[ink(storage)]
	pub struct MyContract {
		number: u32,
	}

	impl MyContract {
		/// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the given `init_value`.
		#[ink(constructor)]
		pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self {
			Self {
				number: init_value,
			}
		}

		/// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the `u32` default.
		///
		/// Constructors can delegate to other constructors.
		#[ink(constructor)]
		pub fn default() -> Self {
			Self {
				number: Default::default(),
			}
		}
	/* --snip-- */
	}
}
```

## Update your smart contract 

Now that you have learned about storing simple values, declaring data types, and using constructors, you can update your smart contract source code to implement the following:

* Create a storage value called `value` with a data type of `i32`.
* Create a new `Incrementer` constructor and set its `value` to `init_value`.
* Create a second constructor function named `default` that has no input, and creates a new `Incrementer` with its `value` set to `0`.

To update the smart contract:

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Replace the `Storage Declaration` comment by declaring the storage item named `value` with the data type of `i32`.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Incrementer {
        value: i32,
    }
    ```

1. Modify the `Incrementer` constructor to set its `value` to `init_value`.
    
    ```rust
    impl Incrementer {
      #[ink(constructor)]
      pub fn new(init_value: i32) -> Self {
            Self {
              value: init_value,
            }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Add a second constructor function named `default` that creates a new `Incrementer` with its `value` set to `0`.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            value: 0,
        }
    }
    ```
    
1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Use the `test` subcommand and `nightly` toolchain to test your work by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```
    
    The command should display output similar to the following to indicate successful test completion:

    ```text
    running 1 test
    test incrementer::tests::default_works ... ok
    
    test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    ```

## Add a function to get a storage value

Now that you have created and initialized a storage value, you can interact with it using public and private functions.
For this tutorial, you add a public function to get a storage value.
Note that all public functions must use the `#[ink(message)]` attribute macro.

To add the public function to the smart contract:

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Update the `get` public function to return the data for the `value` storage item that has the `i32` data type.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn get(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Because this function only _reads_ from the contract storage, it uses the `&self` parameter to access the contract functions and storage items. 
    This function does not allow changes to the state of the `value` storage item.

    If the last expression in a function does not have a semicolon (;), Rust treats it as the return value.

1. Replace the `Test Your Contract` comment in the private `default_works` function with code to test the `get` function.
    
    ```rust
    fn default_works() {
        let contract = Incrementer::default();
        assert_eq!(contract.get(), 0);
    }
    ```

1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Use the `test` subcommand and `nightly` toolchain to test your work by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```
    
## Add a function to modify the storage value

At this point, the smart contract does not allow users modify the storage.
To enable users to _modify_ storage items, you must explicitly mark `value` as a mutable variable.

To add a function for incrementing the stored value:

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Add a new `inc` public function to increment the `value` stored using the `by` parameter that has data type of `i32`.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn inc(&mut self, by: i32) {
        self.value += by;
        }
    }
    ```

1. Add a new test to the source code to verify this function.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink::test]
    fn it_works() {
      let mut contract = Incrementer::new(42);
      assert_eq!(contract.get(), 42);
      contract.inc(5);
      assert_eq!(contract.get(), 47);
      contract.inc(-50);
       assert_eq!(contract.get(), -3);
    }
    ```

1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Use the `test` subcommand and `nightly` toolchain to test your work by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```
    
    The command should display output similar to the following to indicate successful test completion:

    ```bash
    running 2 tests
    test incrementer::tests::it_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::default_works ... ok
    
    test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    ```

### Build the WebAssembly for the contract

After you test the `incrementer` contract, you are ready to compile this project to WebAssembly.
After you compile the smart contract to WebAssembly, you can use the [Contracts UI](https://paritytech.github.io/contracts-ui) to deploy and test the smart contract on your local contracts node.

To build the WebAssembly for this smart contract:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer, if needed.

1. Verify that you are in the `incrementer` project folder.

1. Compile the `incrementer` smart contract by running the following command: 
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly contract build
    ```

    The command displays output similar to the following:

    ```text
    Your contract artifacts are ready. You can find them in:
    /Users/dev-docs/incrementer/target/ink
    
    - incrementer.contract (code + metadata)
    - incrementer.wasm (the contract's code)
    - metadata.json (the contract's metadata)
    ```

## Deploy and test the smart contract

If you have the [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node) node installed locally, you can start a local blockchain node for your smart contract, then use the [Contracts UI](https://paritytech.github.io/contracts-ui) to deploy and test the smart contract.

To deploy on the local node:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer, if needed.

1. Start the contracts node in local development mode by running the following command:

   ```bash
   substrate-contracts-node --dev
   ```

1. Open the [Contracts UI](https://paritytech.github.io/contracts-ui) and verify that it is connected to the local node.

1. Click **Add New Contract**.

1. Click **Upload New Contract Code**.

1. Select the `incrementer.contract` file, then click **Next**.

1. Click **Upload and Instantiate**.

1. Explore and interact with the smart contract using the Contracts UI.

## Use maps for storing values <a name="use-mapping"></a>

At this point, you have developed a smart contract for storing and retrieving a single numeric value.
The next part of the tutorial illustrates how you can extend the functionality of your smart contract to manage one number per user.
To add this functionality, you'll use the [`Mapping`](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_storage/struct.Mapping.html) type.

The ink! language provides the [`Mapping`](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_storage/struct.Mapping.html) type to enable you to store data as key-value pairs.
For example, the following code illustrates mapping a user to a number:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyContract {
	// Store a mapping from AccountIds to a u32
	my_number_map: ink_storage::Mapping<AccountId, u32>,
}
```

With the `Mapping` data type, you can store a unique instance of the storage value for each key. 
For this tutorial, each `AccountId` represents a key that maps to one and only one stored numeric `my_value`. 
Each user can only store, increment, and retrieve the value associated with his or her own `AccountId`.

### Initialize a mapping

The first step is to initialize the mapping between an `AccountId` and a stored value. 
You must always initialize a mapping before you use it in your contract to avoid mapping errors and inconsistencies.
To initialize a mapping, you need to do the following:

* Add the [`SpreadAllocate`](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_storage/traits/trait.SpreadAllocate.html) trait on the storage structure.

* Specify the mapping key and the value mapped to it.

* Call the [`ink_lang::utils::initalize_contract`](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_lang/utils/fn.initialize_contract.html) function to initialize the mapping for the contract.

The following example illustrates how to initialize a mapping and retrieve a value:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod mycontract {
    use ink_storage::traits::SpreadAllocate;

    #[ink(storage)]
    #[derive(SpreadAllocate)]
    pub struct MyContract {
        // Store a mapping from AccountIds to a u32
        map: ink_storage::Mapping<AccountId, u32>,
    }

    impl MyContract {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(count: u32) -> Self {
            // This call is required to correctly initialize the
            // Mapping of the contract.
            ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract(|contract: &mut Self| {
                let caller = Self::env().caller();
                contract.map.insert(&caller, &count);
            })
        }

        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract(|_| {})
        }

        // Get the number associated with the caller's AccountId, if it exists
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> u32 {
            let caller = Self::env().caller();
            self.map.get(&caller).unwrap_or_default()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Identifying the contract caller

In the preceding example, you might have noticed the `self.env().caller()` function call. 
This function is available throughout the contract logic and always returns the **contract caller**.
It is important to note that the contract caller is not the same as the **origin caller**. 
If a user accesses a contract that then calls a subsequent contract, the `self.env().caller()` in the second contract is the address of the first contract, not the original user.

#### Using the contract caller

There are many scenarios where having the contract caller available is useful. 
For example, you can use `self.env().caller()` to create an access control layer that only allows users to access their own values. 
You can also use `self.env().caller()` to save the contract owner during contract deployment.
For example:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod mycontract {

	#[ink(storage)]
	pub struct MyContract {
		// Store a contract owner
		owner: AccountId,
	}

	impl MyContract {
		#[ink(constructor)]
		pub fn new() -> Self {
			Self {
				owner: Self::env().caller();
			}
		}
		/* --snip-- */
	}
}
```

Because you have saved the contract caller using the `owner` identifier, you can later write functions that check whether the current contract caller is the owner of the contract.

### Add mapping to the smart contract

You are now ready to introduce a storage map to the `incrementer` contract.

To add a storage map to the `incrementer` contract:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer, if needed.

1. Verify that you are in the `incrementer` project folder.

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Import the `SpreadAllocate` trait and derive it for your contract.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink::contract
    mod incrementer {
        use ink_storage::traits::SpreadAllocate;
        
        #[ink(storage)]
        #[derive(SpreadAllocate)]
    ```

1. Add the mapping key from `AccountId` to the `i32` data type stored as `my_value`.
    
    ```rust
    pub struct Incrementer {
        value: i32,
        my_value: ink_storage::Mapping<AccountId, i32>,
    }
1. Use the `initialize_contract` function to set an initial `value` and `my_value` for the `new` function in the contract.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new(init_value: i32) -> Self {
        ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract(|contract: &mut Self| {
            contract.value = init_value;
            let caller = Self::env().caller();
            contract.my_value.insert(&caller, &0);
        })
    }

1. Use the `initialize_contract` function to set an initial `value` for the `default` function in the contract.

    ```rust
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn default() -> Self {
        ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract(|contract: &mut Self| {
            contract.value = Default::default();
        })
    }
    ```

1. Add a `get_mine` function to read `my_value` using the Mapping API `get` function and return `my_value` for the contract caller .
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn get_mine(&self) -> i32 {
        self.my_value.get(&self.env().caller()).unwrap_or_default()
    }
    ```

1. Add a new test to the initialize accounts.
    
    ```rust
     #[ink::test]
    fn my_value_works() {
        let contract = Incrementer::new(11);
        assert_eq!(contract.get(), 11);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 0);
    }

1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Use the `test` subcommand and `nightly` toolchain to test your work by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```
    
    The command should display output similar to the following to indicate successful test completion:

    ```bash
    running 3 tests
    test incrementer::tests::default_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::it_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::my_value_works ... ok
    
    test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    ```

### Insert, update, or remove values

The final step in the Incrementer contract is to allow users to update their own values.
You can use calls to the Mapping API to provide this functionality in the smart contract.

The `ink_storage` Mapping provides direct access to storage items. 
For example, you can replace a previous value held for a storage item by calling `Mapping::insert()` with an existing key. 
You can also update values by first reading them from storage using `Mapping::get()`, then update the value with `Mapping::insert()`.
If there is no existing value at a given key, `Mapping::get()` returns
`None`.

Because the Mapping API provides direct access to storage, you can use the
 `Mapping::remove()` method to remove the value at a given key from storage.

To add insert and remove functions to the contract:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer, if needed.

1. Verify that you are in the `incrementer` project folder.

1. Open the `lib.rs` file in a text editor.

1. Add an `inc_mine()` function that allows the contract caller to get the `my_value` storage item and insert an incremented `value` into the mapping.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn inc_mine(&mut self, by: i32) {
        let caller = self.env().caller();
        let my_value = self.get_mine();
        self.my_value.insert(caller, &(my_value + by));
    }
    ```

1. Add a `remove_mine()` function that allows the contract caller to get the clear the `my_value` storage item from storage.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn remove_mine(&self) {
        self.my_value.remove(&self.env().caller())
    }
    ```
 
1. Add a new test to verify that the `inc_mine()` functions works as expected.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink::test]
    fn inc_mine_works() {
        let mut contract = Incrementer::new(11);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 0);
        contract.inc_mine(5);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 5);
        contract.inc_mine(5);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 10);
    }
    ```

1. Add a new test to verify that the `remove_mine()` functions works as expected.
    
    ```rust
    #[ink::test]
    fn remove_mine_works() {
        let mut contract = Incrementer::new(11);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 0);
        contract.inc_mine(5);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 5);
        contract.remove_mine();
        assert_eq!(contract.get_mine(), 0);
    }
    ```

1. Use the `test` subcommand and `nightly` toolchain to test your work by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cargo +nightly test
    ```
    
    The command should display output similar to the following to indicate successful test completion:

    ```bash
    running 5 tests
    test incrementer::tests::default_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::it_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::remove_mine_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::inc_mine_works ... ok
    test incrementer::tests::my_value_works ... ok
    
    test result: ok. 5 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    ```
