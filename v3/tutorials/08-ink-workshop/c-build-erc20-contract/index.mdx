## Learning outcomes

- Initial token minting
- Tokens transfer
- Approvals and third party transfers
- Emitting runtime events through Substrate

But first, we will go over the ERC20 standard for those of you who are not familiar.

## ERC20 Standard

The [ERC20 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) defines the interface for the most popular Ethereum smart contract.

```javascript
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ERC Token Standard #20 Interface
// https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

contract ERC20Interface {
    // Storage Getters
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public view returns (uint remaining);

    // Public Functions
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    // Contract Events
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}
```

In summary, it allows individuals to deploy their own cryptocurrency on top of an existing smart
contract platform. There isn't much magic happening in this contract. Users balances are stored in a
HashMap, and a set of APIs are built to allow users to transfer tokens they own or allow a third
party to transfer some amount of tokens on their behalf. Most importantly, all of this logic is
implemented ensuring that funds are not unintentionally created or destroyed, and that a user's
funds are protected from malicious actors.

Note that all the public functions return a `bool` which specifies if the call was successful or not.
We will adhere to that specification.

## Creating the ERC20 Template

We are going to start another ink! project to build an ERC20 token contract.

Back in your working directory, run:

```bash
cargo contract new erc20
```

Again, we will replace the `lib.rs` file content with the template provided on the right panel.

You will notice that the template for the ERC20 token is VERY similar to the Incrementer contract.
(Coincidence? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

The storage (so far) consists of:

- `total_supply`: a storage `Value`, representing the total supply of tokens in our contract.
- `balances`: a storage `HashMap`, representing the individual balance of each account.

### 1. ERC20 Deployment

The most basic ERC20 token contract is a fixed supply token. During contract deployment, all the
tokens will be automatically given to the contract creator. It is then up to the creator to
distribute those tokens to other users as he sees fit.

Of course, this is not the only way to mint and distribute tokens, but the most simple one, and what
we will be doing here.

So remember to `set` the total balance and `insert` the balance of the `Self::env().caller()`

### 2. Your Turn

This chapter should be nothing more than a quick refresher of the content you already learned.

You need to:

- Set up a constructor function which initializes the two storage items
- Create getters for both storage items
- Create a `balance_of_or_zero` function to handle reading values from the HashMap

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.

## Transferring Tokens

So at this point, we have a single user that owns all the tokens for the contract. However, it's not
_really_ a useful token unless you can transfer them to other people...

Let's do that!

### 1. Transfer Functions

The `transfer` function does exactly what you might expect: it allows the user calling the contract
to transfer some funds they own to another user.

You will notice in our template code there is a public function `transfer` and an internal function
`transfer_from_to`. We have done this because in the future, we will be reusing the logic for a
token transfer when we enable third party allowances and spending on-behalf-of.

#### transfer_from_to()

```rust
fn transfer_from_to(&mut self, from: AccountId, to: AccountId, value: Balance) -> bool {
  /* --snip-- */
}
```

The `transfer_from_to` function will be built without any _authorization_ checks. Because it is an
internal function we fully control when it gets called. However, it will have all logical checks
around managing the balances between accounts.

Really we just need to check for one thing: make sure that the `from` account has enough funds to
send to the `to` account, something likes the following:

```rust
if balance_from < value {
    return false
}
```

Remember that the `transfer` function and other public functions return a bool to indicate success.
If the `from` account does not have enough balance to satisfy the transfer, we will exit early and
return false, not making any changes to the contract state. Our `transfer_from_to` will simply
forward the "success" `bool` up to the function that calls it.

#### transfer()

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, value: Balance) -> bool {
  /* --snip-- */
}
```

Finally, the `transfer` function will simply call into the `transfer_from_to` with the `from`
parameter automatically set to the `self.env().caller()`. This is our "authorization check" since
the contract caller is always authorized to move their own funds.

### 2. Transfer Math

There really is not much to say about the simple math executed within a token transfer.

1. First we get the current balance of both the `from` and `to` account, making sure to use our
   `balance_of_or_zero()` getter.
2. Then we make the logic check mentioned above to ensure the `from` balance has enough funds to
   send `value`.
3. Finally, we subtract that `value` from the `from` balance and add it to the `to` balance and
   insert those new values back in.

### 3. Your Turn

Follow the `ACTION`s in the template code to build your transfer function.

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.

## Creating Events

Recall that contract calls cannot directly return a value to the outside world when submitting a
transaction. However, often we will want to indicate to the outside world that something has taken
place (e.g. a transaction has occurred or a certain state has been reached). We can alert others
that this has occurred using an `event`.

### 1. Declaring Events

An event can communicate an arbitrary amount of data, defined in a similar manner as a `struct`.
Events should be declared using the `#[ink(event)]` attribute.

For example,

```rust
#[ink(event)]
pub struct Transfer {
    #[ink(topic)]
    from: Option<AccountId>,
    #[ink(topic)]
    to: Option<AccountId>,
    value: Balance,
}
```

This `Transfer` event will contain three pieces of data - a value of type `Balance` and two
Option-wrapped `AccountId` variables indicating the `from` and `to` accounts. For faster access to
the event data they can have _indexed fields_. We can do this by using the `#[ink(topic)]` attribute
tag on that field.

One way of retrieving data from an `Option<T>` variable is using the `.unwrap_or()` function. You may
recall using this in the `my_value_or_zero()` and `balance_of_or_zero()` functions in this project
and the Incrementer project.

### 2. Emitting Events

Now that we have defined what data will be contained within the event and how to declare it, it's
time to actually emit some events. We do this by calling `self.env().emit_event()` and include an
event as the sole argument to the method call.

Remember that since the `from` and `to` fields are `Option<AccountId>`, we can't just set them to
particular values. Let's assume we want to set an value of 100 for the initial deployer. This value
does not come from any other account, and so the `from` value should be `None`.

```rust
self.env()
    .emit_event(
        Transfer {
            from: None,
            to: Some(self.env().caller()),
            value: 100,
        });
```

Notice that `value` does not need a `Some()`, as the value is not stored in an `Option`.

We want to emit a `Transfer` event every time that a transfer takes place. In the ERC-20 template
that we have been working on, this occurs in two places: first, during the `new` call, and second,
every time that `transfer_from_to` is called.

### 3. Your Turn

Follow the ACTIONs in the template code to emit a `Transfer` event every time a token transfer occurs.

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.

## Supporting `approval` and `transfer_from`

We are almost there! Our token contract can now transfer funds from user to user and tell the
outside world what is going on when this happens. All that is left to do is introduce the `approve`
and `transfer_from` functions.

### 1. Third Parity Transfers

This section is all about adding the ability for other accounts to safely spend some amount of your
tokens.

The immediate question should be: "Why the heck would I want that?"

Well, one such scenario is to support Decentralized Exchanges. Basically, other smart contracts can
allow you to exchange tokens with other users, usually one type of token for another. However, these
"bids" do not always execute right away. Maybe you want to get a really good deal for token trade,
and will hold out until that trade is met.

Well, rather than giving your tokens directly to the contract (an escrow), you can simply "approve"
them to spend some of your tokens on your behalf! This means that during the time while you are
waiting for a trade to execute, you can still control and spend your funds if needed. Better yet,
you can approve multiple different contracts or users to access your funds, so if one contract
offers the best trade, you do not need to pull out funds from the other and move them, a sometimes
costly and time consuming process.

So hopefully you can see why a feature like this would be useful, but how can we do it safely?

We use a two step process: **Approve** and **Transfer From**.

#### Approve

Approving another account to spend your funds is the first step in the third party transfer process.
A token owner can specify another account and any arbitrary number of tokens it can spend on the
owner's behalf. The owner need not have all their funds approved to be spent by others; in the
situation where there is not enough funds, the approved account can spend up to the approved amount
from the owner's balance.

When an account calls `approve` multiple times, the approved value simply overwrites any existing
value that was approved in the past. By default, the approved value between any two accounts is `0`,
and a user can always call approve for `0` to revoke access to their funds from another account.

To store approvals in our contract, we need to use a slightly fancy `HashMap`.

Since each account can have a different amount approved for any other accounts to use, we need to
use a tuple as our key which simply points to a balance value. Here is an example of what that
would look like:

```rust
pub struct Erc20 {
    /// Balances that are spendable by non-owners: (owner, spender) -> allowed
    allowances: ink_storage::collections::HashMap<(AccountId, AccountId), Balance>,
}
```

Here we have defined the tuple to represent `(owner, spender)` such that we can look up how much a
"spender" can spend from an "owner's" balance using the `AccountId`s in this tuple. Remember that we
will need to again create an `allowance_of_or_zero` function to help us get the allowance of an
account when it is not initialized, and a getter function called `allowance` to look up the current
value for any pair of accounts.

```rust
/// Approve the passed AccountId to spend the specified amount of tokens
/// on the behalf of the message's sender.
#[ink(message)]
pub fn approve(&mut self, spender: AccountId, value: Balance) -> bool {/* --snip-- */}
```

When you call the `approve` function, you simply insert the `value` specified into storage. The `owner` is always the `self.env().caller()`, ensuring that the function call is always authorized.

#### Transfer From

Finally, once we have set up an approval for one account to spend on-behalf-of another, we need to create a special `transfer_from` function which enables an approved user to transfer those funds.

As mentioned earlier, we will take advantage of the private `transfer_from_to` function to do the bulk of our transfer logic. All we need to introduce is the _authorization_ logic again.

So what does it mean to be authorized to call this function?

1. The `self.env().caller()` must have some allowance to spend funds from the `from` account.
2. The allowance must not be less than the value trying to be transferred.

In code, that can easily be represented like so:

```rust
let allowance = self.allowance_of_or_zero(&from, &self.env().caller());
if allowance < value {
    return false
}
/* --snip-- */
true
```

Again, we exit early and return false if our authorization does not pass.

If everything looks good though, we simply `insert` the updated allowance into the `allowance` HashMap (`let new_allowance = allowance - value`), and call the `transfer_from_to` between the specified `from` and `to` accounts.

### 2. Be Careful!

If you glaze over the logic of this function too quickly, you may introduce a bug into your smart contract. Remember when calling `transfer_from`, the `self.env().caller()` and the `from` account is used to look up the current allowance, but the `transfer_from` function is called between the `from` and `to` account specified.

There are three account variables in play whenever `transfer_from` is called, and you need to make sure to use them correctly! Hopefully our test will catch any mistake you make.

### 3. Your Turn!

You are almost there! This is the last piece of the ERC20 token contract.

Follow the `ACTION`s in the contract template to finish your ERC20 implementation.

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.

## Testing Our Contract

Now let's conclude our ERC20 token implementation by walking through some test cases we have put forward
when you are filling in the code in the previous sections. In fact if you have been following along
on the coding exercise and running `cargo +nightly test` at the end to make sure the output are okay,
you have been running the test cases all along.

### 1. Motivation

In software engineering practice, it is true that writing automatic test cases cannot be emphasized
enough. There are many type of tests one can write and here we are focusing on writing **Unit Tests**.
This means we as developers know the code logic (versus testing assuming not knowing the logic, a.k.a.
[black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing)) and we write test cases to
verify a function perform as we expected by giving it certain inputs and verifying it is returning
the result we expect. Along the way we also test for edge cases, e.g. how it would handle empty value,
or value that is out of its expected bound, and test for certain error handling mechanism is executed
or error message is returned.

The benefit of having unit tests written are so that once our program get big or during
future code refactoring, we can run these tests and if we see them pass, we have the confident that
our main program still works.

### 2. Unit Test Structure

Now let's get to walking through some test cases for smart contract. They can be seen at the
bottom section of the code on the right panel.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  use super::*;
  use ink_lang as ink;
  // snip...
}
```

`#[cfg(test)]` is specified so the code section immediately below it is run only when `cargo test`
is executed but not in the normally-executed `cargo run`. We shorthand all code logic defined above
with `use super::*`, and alias `ink_lang` as `ink`.

The first test case is just:

```rust
#[ink::test]
fn new_works() {
  let contract = Erc20::new(777);
  assert_eq!(contract.total_supply(), 777);
}
```

Each test case is a normal function definition returning nothing prepended by the `#[ink::test]`
attribute macro. Inside the function, we setup for certain conditions and then assert for certain
results. If the assert statement fail, it will panic and the test will abort with error message.

In the above test case, we just define a new contract with `777` as the total supply, and verify
the total supply is indeed `777`.

Now, let's walk through a more complex one, the last test case.

```rust
#[ink::test]
fn transfer_from_works() {
  let mut contract = Erc20::new(100);
  assert_eq!(contract.balance_of(AccountId::from([0x1; 32])), 100);
  contract.approve(AccountId::from([0x1; 32]), 20);
  contract.transfer_from(AccountId::from([0x1; 32]), AccountId::from([0x0; 32]), 10);
  assert_eq!(contract.balance_of(AccountId::from([0x0; 32])), 10);
}
```

We first define a contract with `100` total supply. By default in testing, the account calling for
all contract code is `0x00000001`. So here we assert that the contract creator has all the total supply
at the beginning.

Then we approve `0x00000001` to have an allowance of 20 to transfer his own fund.

> **Note**: Notice this line is called with account `0x00000001`, so it may look silly that `0x00000001` has
> to approve himself to use his own fund. In fact if he call `transfer()` directly, he can still
> transfer fund to others. But with `transfer_from()` we know that `approve()` has the logic to set the
> allowance amount so `0x00000001` can call `transfer_from()` later and succeed.

Afterward, we make a `transfer_from()` call, and ensure the destination account has the expected
amount.

You could also refer to the API doc on further usage of
[`assert!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html) and
[`assert_eq!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html).

Congratulation! You have completed the tutorial and you write your own ERC20 token smart contract
using ink! in Substrate.
