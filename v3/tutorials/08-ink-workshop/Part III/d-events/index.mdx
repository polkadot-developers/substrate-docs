Recall that contract calls cannot directly return a value to the outside world when submitting a
transaction.  However, often we will want to indicate to the outside world that something has taken
place (e.g. a transaction has occurred or a certain state has been reached).  We can alert others
that this has occurred using an `event`.

## Declaring Events

An event can communicate an arbitrary amount of data, defined in a similar manner as a `struct`.
Events should be declared using the `#[ink(event)]` attribute.

For example,

```rust
#[ink(event)]
pub struct Transfer {
    #[ink(topic)]
    from: Option<AccountId>,
    #[ink(topic)]
    to: Option<AccountId>,
    value: Balance,
}
```

This `Transfer` event will contain three pieces of data - a value of type `Balance` and two
Option-wrapped `AccountId` variables indicating the `from` and `to` accounts. For faster access to
the event data they can have _indexed fields_. We can do this by using the `#[ink(topic)]` attribute
tag on that field.

One way of retrieving data from an `Option<T>` variable is using the `.unwrap_or()` function.  You may
recall using this in the `my_value_or_zero()` and `balance_of_or_zero()` functions in this project
and the Incrementer project.

## Emitting Events

Now that we have defined what data will be contained within the event and how to declare it, it's
time to actually emit some events. We do this by calling `self.env().emit_event()` and include an
event as the sole argument to the method call.

Remember that since the `from` and `to` fields are `Option<AccountId>`, we can't just set them to
particular values. Let's assume we want to set an value of 100 for the initial deployer.  This value
does not come from any other account, and so the `from` value should be `None`.

```rust
self.env()
    .emit_event(
        Transfer {
            from: None,
            to: Some(self.env().caller()),
            value: 100,
        });
```

> Note: `value` does not need a `Some()`, as the value is not stored in an `Option`.

We want to emit a `Transfer` event every time that a transfer takes place. In the ERC-20 template
that we have been working on, this occurs in two places: first, during the `new` call, and second,
every time that `transfer_from_to` is called.

## Your Turn

Follow the ACTIONs in the template code to emit a `Transfer` event every time a token transfer occurs.

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.
