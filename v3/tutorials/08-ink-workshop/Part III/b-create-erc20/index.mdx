We are going to start another ink! project to build an ERC20 token contract.

Back in your working directory, run:

```bash
cargo contract new erc20
```

Again, we will replace the `lib.rs` file content with the template provided on the right panel.

You will notice that the template for the ERC20 token is VERY similar to the Incrementer contract.
(Coincidence? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

The storage (so far) consists of:

- `total_supply`: a storage `Value`, representing the total supply of tokens in our contract.
- `balances`: a storage `HashMap`, representing the individual balance of each account.

## ERC20 Deployment

The most basic ERC20 token contract is a fixed supply token. During contract deployment, all the
tokens will be automatically given to the contract creator. It is then up to the creator to
distribute those tokens to other users as he sees fit.

Of course, this is not the only way to mint and distribute tokens, but the most simple one, and what
we will be doing here.

So remember to `set` the total balance and `insert` the balance of the `Self::env().caller()`

## Your Turn

This chapter should be nothing more than a quick refresher of the content you already learned.

You need to:

- Set up a constructor function which initializes the two storage items
- Create getters for both storage items
- Create a `balance_of_or_zero` function to handle reading values from the HashMap

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.
