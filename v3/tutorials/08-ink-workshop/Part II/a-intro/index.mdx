This chapter will get you started developing smart contracts with ink!.

We will build a simple **Incrementer** contract which holds a number which you can increase with a function call.

Over the course of this chapter you will learn:

- The structure of ink! smart contracts
- To store single values and hash maps
- To safely get and set these values
- To build public and private functions
- To configure Rust to use safe math
