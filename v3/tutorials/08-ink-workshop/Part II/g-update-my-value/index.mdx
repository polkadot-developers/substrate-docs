The final step in our Incrementer contract is to allow users to update their own values.

## Modifying a HashMap

Making changes to the value of a HashMap is just as sensitive as getting the value. If you try to modify some value before it has been initialized, your contract will panic!

But have no fear, we can continue to use the `my_number_or_zero` function we created to protect us from these situations!

```rust
impl MyContract {

    /* --snip-- */

    // Set the value for the calling AccountId
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn set_my_number(&mut self, value: u32) {
        let caller = self.env().caller();
        self.my_number_map.insert(caller, value);
    }

    // Add a value to the existing value for the calling AccountId
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn add_my_number(&mut self, value: u32) {
        let caller = self.env().caller();
        let my_number = self.my_number_or_zero(&caller);
        self.my_number_map.insert(caller, my_number + value);
    }

    /// Returns the number for an AccountId or 0 if it is not set.
    fn my_number_or_zero(&self, of: &AccountId) -> u32 {
        *self.my_number_map.get(of).unwrap_or(&0)
    }
}
```

Here we have written two kinds of functions which modify a HashMap. One simply inserts the value
directly into storage, with no need to read the value first, and another one modifies the existing
value. Note how we can always `insert` the value without worry, as that initialized the value in
storage, but before you can get or modify anything, we need to call `my_number_or_zero` to make
sure we are working with a real value.

## Update or Insert (Upsert)

We will not always have an existing value on our contract's storage. We can take advantage of the
Rust `Option<T>` type to help us.
If there's no value on the contract storage we will insert a new one; on the contrary if there is
an existing value we will only update it.

ink! HashMaps expose the well-known
[**HashMap Entry API**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/collections/hash_map/enum.Entry.html)
that we can use to achieve this type of "upsert" behavior:

```rust
let caller = self.env().caller();
self.my_number_map
    .entry(caller)
    .and_modify(|old_value| *old_value += by)
    .or_insert(by);
```
