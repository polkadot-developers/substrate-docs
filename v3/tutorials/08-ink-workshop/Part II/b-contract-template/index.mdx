Let's take a look at a high level what is available to you when developing a smart contract using ink!.

## ink!

ink! is an
[Embedded Domain Specific Language](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language)
(EDSL) that you can use to write WebAssembly based smart contracts in the Rust programming language.

ink! is just standard Rust in a well defined "contract format" with specialized `#[ink(...)]` attribute macros. These attribute macros tell ink! what the different parts of your Rust smart contract represent, and ultimately allow ink! to do all the magic needed to create Substrate compatible Wasm bytecode!

## Your Turn

Let's start a new project for the Incrementer contract that you will build in this chapter.

Change into your working directory and run:

```bash
cargo contract new incrementer
```

Just like in previous example, this will create a new project folder named `incrementer` which we
will use for the rest of this chapter.

```bash
cd incrementer/
```

In the `lib.rs` file, replace the "Flipper" contract source code with the template code provided
here.

Quickly check that it compiles and the trivial test passes with:

```bash
cargo +nightly test
```

Also check that you can build the Wasm file by running:

```bash
cargo +nightly contract build
```

If everything looks good, then we are ready to start programming!
