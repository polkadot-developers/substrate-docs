Now that we have generated the Wasm binary from our source code and started a Canvas node, we want
to deploy this contract onto our Substrate blockchain.

Smart contract deployment on Substrate is a little different than on traditional smart contract
blockchains.

Whereas a completely new blob of smart contract source code is deployed each time you push a
contract on other platforms, Substrate opts to optimize this behavior. For example, the standard
ERC20 token has been deployed to Ethereum thousands of times, sometimes only with changes to the
initial configuration (through the Solidity `constructor` function). Each of these instances take
up space on the blockchain equivalent to the contract source code size, even though no code was
actually changed.

In Substrate, the contract deployment process is split into two steps:

1. Putting your contract code on the blockchain
2. Creating an instance of your contract

With this pattern, contract code like the ERC20 standard can be put on the blockchain one single
time, but instantiated any number of times. No need to continually upload the same source code over
and waste space on the blockchain.

## Upload Contract Code and Instantiate a Contract on the Blockchain

Here we will upload the contract code and instantiate one copy of the contract on the blockchain (
which is usually why we upload the contract code in the first place):

- Click the **Upload & Instantiate Contract** button.
- Choose an **Instantiation account** (e.g. ALICE).
- Give the contract a descriptive **Name** (e.g. Flipper Contract).
- Drag the `flipper.contract` file that contains the bundled Wasm blob and metadata into the drag
& drop area. You will see the UI parse the metadata and showing what functions the contract contains.
- Click the **Constructor Details**

Smart contracts exist as an extension of the account system on the blockchain. Thus creating an
instance of this contract will create a new `AccountId` which will store any balance managed by the
smart contract and allow us to interact with the contract.

Now a screen displays the information that represents our smart contract. We are going to
instantiate a copy of the smart contract:

- Give the contract instance a **Contract Name** (e.g. The First Flipper).
- Accept the default options for the contract **Instantiation Constructor**.
- Accept the default options **Endowment** of `1000 Units` to pay the storage rent, and **Max Gas
Allowed** of `200000`.
- Click on `Instantiate`

> **Note:** As mentioned earlier, contract creation involves creation of a new account. As such, you
must be sure to give the contract account at least the existential deposit defined by your
blockchain. We also need to be able to pay the contract's rent (endowment). If we consume all of
this deposit, the contract will become a tombstone. We can always refill the contract's balance and
keep it on chain.

When you click **Instantiate**, and in the next confirmation screen **Sign & Submit**, you should see
the extrinsic `contracts.instantiateWithCode` is called, and a flurry of events appear including the
creation of a new account (`system.NewAccount`) and the instantiation of the contract
(`contracts.Instantiated`):
