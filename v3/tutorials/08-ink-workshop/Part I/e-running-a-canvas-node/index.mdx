After successfully installing `canvas`, you can start a local development chain by running:

```bash
canvas --dev --tmp
```

![Substrate Canvas node](assets/start-canvas-node.png)

You should start seeing blocks being produced by your node in your terminal.

You can interact with your node using the hosted version of Canvas UI at:

https://paritytech.github.io/canvas-ui

Now configure the UI to connect to the locally running node:

- Click on the dropdown selector at bottom left corner.
- Choose the Local Node.
