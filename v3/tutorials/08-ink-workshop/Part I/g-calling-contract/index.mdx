Now that your contract has been fully deployed, we can start interacting with it! Flipper only has
two functions, `flip()` and `get()` so we will show you what it's like to play with both of them.
Click the **Execute** button under the contract after you instantiate the Flipper contract in the
previous step.

## get() function

Take a look at our contract's `default()` function, we set the initial value of the Flipper contract
`value` to `No` when we instantiated the contract. Let's check that this is the case.

In the **Message to Send** section, select the "**get(): bool**" message and accept the default
values for the other options.

Press **"Call"** and confirm that it returns the value `false`:

> NOTE: You might be wondering "Why did we need to specify gas when reading a value from a contract?"
>
> If you notice right above the "Call" button is a dropdown select box that allows you to "Send as
RPC call" or "Send as transaction". For a read-only request like this, we can simply use an RPC call
which will _simulate_ a transaction, but not actually storing anything on-chain. Thus, you will still need to specify the right amount of gas to cover your "virtual fee". But don't worry, nothing will be charged when making a call this way. :)

## flip() function

So let's make the value turn `true` now!

The alternative message to send with the UI is `flip()`. Again, accept the default values for the other options.

You will notice that the `flip()` message defaults to a transaction call.

If the transaction was successful, we should then be able to go back to the `get()` function and see our updated storage:

Woohoo! You deployed your first smart contract!

## Moving Forward

We will not go over these setup and deployment steps again, but you can use them throughout the
tutorial to deploy certain contract on-chain.

The rest of the tutorial will have **template code** which you will use to walk through the
different steps of contract development. Each template comes with a fully designed suite of tests
that should pass if you programmed your contract correctly. Before you move on from a section, make
sure that you run:

```bash
cargo +nightly test
```

and that the tests all execute successfully without any warnings.

You need not deploy your contract between each section, but if we ask you to deploy your contract,
you will need to follow these same steps you have done with the Flipper contract.
