Run the following command to compile your smart contract in Flipper project directory:

```bash
cargo +nightly contract build
```

This command will build for the ink! project a Wasm binary, a metadata file (which contains the
contract's ABI) and a `.contract` file which bundles both. This `.contract` file can be used for
deploying your contract to your chain. If all goes well, you should see a `target` folder which
contains these files:

```
target
  └─ debug
    └─ ...
  └─ ink
    └─ release
      └─ ...
    └─ CACHEDIR.TAG
    └─ flipper.contract
    └─ flipper.wasm
    └─ metadata.json
```

Let's take a look at the structure of the `metadata.json`:

``` JSON
{
  "metadataVersion": "0.1.0",
  "source": {...},
  "contract": {...},
  "spec": {
    "constructors": [...],
    "docs": [],
    "events": [],
    "messages": [...],
  },
  "storage": {...},
  "types": [...]
}
```

This file describes all the interfaces that can be used to interact with your contract.

* `types` provides the custom **data types** used throughout the rest of the JSON.
* `storage` defines all the **storage** items managed by your contract and how to ultimately access
them.
* `spec` stores information about the callable functions like **constructors** and **messages** a
user can call to interact with the contract. It also has helpful information like the **events**
that are emitted by the contract or any **docs**.

If you look closely at the constructors and messages, you will also notice a `selector` which
contains a 4-byte hash of the function name and is used to route your contract calls to the correct
functions.

In the next section we will start a [Substrate Canvas node](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node)
and configure the [Canvas UI](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-ui) to interact with it.
