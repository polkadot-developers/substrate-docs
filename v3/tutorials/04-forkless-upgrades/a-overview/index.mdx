One of the defining features of the Substrate blockchain development framework is its support for
**forkless runtime upgrades**. Forkless upgrades are a means of enhancing a blockchain runtime in a
way that is supported and protected by the capabilities of the blockchain itself. A blockchain's
[runtime](../../../v3/docs/concepts/runtime) defines the [state](../../../v3/docs/runtime/storage) the
blockchain can hold and also defines the logic for effecting changes to that state.

Substrate makes it possible to deploy enhanced runtime capabilities (**including _breaking_ changes(!)**)
without a [hard fork](../../../v3/docs/getting-started/glossary#fork). Because the definition of the
runtime is itself an element in a Substrate chain's state, network participants may update this
value by way of an [extrinsic](../../../v3/docs/concepts/extrinsics), specifically
[the `set_code` function](/rustdocs/latest/frame_system/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.set_code).
Since updates to runtime state are bound by the blockchain's consensus mechanisms and cryptographic
guarantees, network participants can use the blockchain itself to trustlessly distribute updated or
extended runtime logic without needing to fork the chain or even release a new blockchain client.

This tutorial will use the Substrate Developer Hub
[Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) to explore two
mechanisms for forkless upgrades of [FRAME](../../../v3/docs/runtime/frame)-based runtimes.
First, the
[`sudo_unchecked_weight`](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_sudo/enum.Call.html#variant.sudo_unchecked_weight)
function from the [Sudo pallet](../../../v3/docs/runtime/frame#sudo) will be used to perform an
upgrade that adds the [Scheduler pallet](../../../v3/docs/runtime/frame#scheduler). Then, the
[`schedule`](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_scheduler/enum.Call.html#variant.schedule)
function from the Scheduler pallet will be used to perform an upgrade that increases the
[existential (minimum) balance](../../../v3/docs/getting-started/glossary#existential-deposit)
for network accounts.

## Before You Begin

1. To get a sense of what they are more concretely, read the
   [runtime upgrade documentation](../../../v3/docs/runtime/upgrades) first, or at least have
   it open as a reference as you progress.

2. If you haven't already, you should complete these tutorials before this one:
   - [Create Your First Substrate Chain](../../tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/) -
     that will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment.
   - [Add a Pallet to Your Runtime](../../tutorials/add-a-pallet) - that will introduce the
     FRAME system for runtime development and guide you through the process of extending the
     capabilities of a FRAME runtime by adding a pallet.

## What You Will Be Doing

Before we even get started, lets' layout what we are going to do over the course of this turorial. We will:
