[Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is a set of modules to build an
**Ethereum-compatible blockchain with Substrate**.

## Getting Started

You should have completed _at least_ the following three Substrate tutorials before attempting this tutorial:

- [Create Your First Substrate Chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain/)
- [Add a Pallet to Your Runtime](/tutorials/v3/add-a-pallet/)
- [Build a PoE Decentralized Application](/tutorials/v3/proof-of-existence)

Before attempting this tutorial, you should be familiar with the concepts listed below:

- Launching a Substrate chain
- Submitting extrinsics
- Adding, Removing, and configuring pallets in a runtime
- Ethereum and EVM basics
- Pallet design

## Frontier Template

This tutorial is presently a little bit out of date. While it is still a good reference, it refers to an older version of Substrate template. It is thus encouraged to generate your own template based of whatever commit you desire from frontier itself to start working with many of the core features of Frontier installed and enabled.

The Frontier project currently does not use the published Substrate
crates; it refers to Subsrate code from github directly. Take note of this in your `Cargo` files. You _must_
use the _matching_ version of dependencies for all of Substrate and Frontier in your project.

This is a stop-gap solution while Frontier is being updated to the latest Substrate tag/release.

There's also a github repo `template` that is available for major Frontier releases pre-generated for you.

#### Generation Script

You can generate a version of the Frontier template by running the
[generation script](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/master/.maintain/node-template-release.sh)
included in Frontier.

```bash
# from the top working dir of Frontier:
cd .maintain/
# set the *full file name with .tar.gz extension* for your output file
./node-template-release.sh TEMPLATE.tar.gz
# Note the file will be placed in the top level working dir of frontier
# Move the archive to wherever you like...
tar xvzf TEMPLATE.tar.gz
# this unpacks into `frontier-node-template` with all your files
cd frontier-node-template
```

The Substrate Developer Hub has generated the template using the
[included release guide](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/master/docs/node-template-release.md)
, and intends to update with major releases of Frontier moving forward.

You can `use` the pre-generated template or `fork` it from here:
https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/frontier-node-template/ .

### Build & Config Setup

#### Genesis Configuration

The development [chain spec](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/master/template/node/src/chain_spec.rs) included with this project defines a genesis
block that has been pre-configured with an EVM account for
[Alice](/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys). When
[a development chain is started](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template#run),
Alice's EVM account will be funded with a large amount of Ether. The
[Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944) can be used to see the details
of Alice's EVM account. In order to view an EVM account, use the `Developer` tab of the Polkadot UI
`Settings` app to define the EVM `Account` type as below. It is also necessary to define the
`Address` and `LookupSource` to send transaction, and `Transaction` and `Signature` to be able to
inspect blocks:

```json
{
  "Address": "MultiAddress",
  "LookupSource": "MultiAddress",
  "Account": {
    "nonce": "U256",
    "balance": "U256"
  },
  "Transaction": {
    "nonce": "U256",
    "action": "String",
    "gas_price": "u64",
    "gas_limit": "u64",
    "value": "U256",
    "input": "Vec<u8>",
    "signature": "Signature"
  },
  "Signature": {
    "v": "u64",
    "r": "H256",
    "s": "H256"
  }
}
```

#### Build & Run

To build the chain, execute the following commands from the project root:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To execute the chain, run:

```bash
./target/release/frontier-template-node --dev
```

The node also supports to use manual seal (to produce block manually through RPC).

```bash
./target/release/frontier-template-node --dev --manual-seal
```

### Query Balance Using RPC

Once your node is running, use the Polkadot JS Apps' `RPC calls` under the `Developer` tab to query `eth > getBalance(address, number)` with Alice's
EVM account ID (`0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558`); the value that is returned should be:

```text
x: eth.getBalance
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455
```

Alice's EVM account ID was calculated using
[an included utility script](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/master/template/utils/README.md#--evm-address-address).

### Deploy & Call Ethereum Smart Contracts

To deploy and call Ethereum smart contracts and test the related functionality follow the next steps at:

- [Testing Ethereum Smart Contracts Functionality](#erc20-contract-deployment).

## Architecture

Here are a few helpful diagrams to help illustrate how the Frontier EVM and Ethereum RPC plug into
your Substrate FRAME runtime.

### EVM Pallet Runtime Configuration

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a sandboxed virtual stack machine that is implemented in the
EVM pallet. The EVM is responsible for executing Ethereum contract bytecode of smart contracts,
typically written in a high level language like Solidity, then compiled to EVM bytecode.

![architecture diagram](../../../src/images/tutorials/10-frontier-workshop/pallet-evm.png)

### Ethereum Pallet

The Ethereum pallet is responsible for storing Ethereum-formatted blocks, transaction receipts, and transaction statuses.

![architecture diagram](../../../src/images/tutorials/10-frontier-workshop/pallet-ethereum.png)

### Wrapping Ethereum Transactions

When a user submits a raw Ethereum transaction, we need to convert it into a Substrate transaction. The conversion is simple. We just wrap the raw transaction in a call the `pallet_ethereum`'s `transact` extrinsic. This is done in the runtime.

> Note that Ethereum Accounts and Substrate accounts in this template are not directly compatible
> for using keys. For an explainer on this, please see the
> [Moonbean documentain on EVM&Substrate Accounts](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/unified-accounts/#substrate-evm-compatible-blockchain)

### Ethereum Specific Runtime APIs & RPCs

Our runtime is storing all the ethereum-formatted information that may be queried, thus we need a
way for the RPC server to call into the runtime and retrieve that information. This is done through
runtime APIs & RPCs.

## ERC20 Contract Deployment

The following steps are also available as a [Typescript script](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template/examples/contract-erc20) using
Polkadot JS SDK.

### Contract creation

The [`truffle`](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template/examples/contract-erc20/truffle) directory contains a
[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) project that defines
[an ERC-20 token](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template/examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.sol). For convenience, this
repository also contains
[the compiled bytecode of this token contract](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template/examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.json#L259),
which can be used to deploy it to the Substrate blockchain.

> Further reading:
> [the ERC-20 token standard](https://github.com/danforbes/danforbes/blob/master/writings/eth-dev.md#EIP-20-ERC-20-Token-Standard)

Use the Polkadot UI `Extrinsics` app to deploy the contract from Alice's account (submit the
extrinsic as a signed transaction) using `evm > create` with the following parameters:

```text
source: 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558
init: <raw contract bytecode, a very long hex value>
value: 0
gas_limit: 4294967295
gas_price: 1
nonce: <empty> {None}
```

The values for `gas_limit` and `gas_price` were chosen for convenience and have little inherent or
special meaning. Note that `None` for the nonce will increment the known nonce for the source
account, starting from `0x0`, you may manually set this but will get an "evm.InvalidNonce" error if
not set correctly.

Once the extrinsic is in a block, navigate to the `Network` -> `Explorer` tab in the UI, or open up
the browser console to see that the EVM pallet has fired a `Created` event with an `address` field
that provides the address of the newly-created contract:

```bash
# console:
... {"phase":{"applyExtrinsic":2},"event":{"index":"0x0901","data":["0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f"]} ...

# UI:
evm.Created
A contract has been created at given [address]
   H160: 0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f
```

In this case, however, it is trivial to
[calculate this value](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/46960):
`0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f`. That is because EVM contract account IDs are
determined solely by the ID and nonce of the contract creator's account and, in this case, both of
those values are well-known (`0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558` and `0x0`, respectively).

### Check Contract Storage

Use the `Chain State` UI tab to query`evm > accountCodes` for both Alice's and the contract's
account IDs; notice that Alice's account code is empty and the contract's is equal to the bytecode
of the Solidity contract.

The ERC-20 contract that was deployed inherits from
[the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)
and extends its capabilities by adding
[a constructor that mints a maximum amount of tokens to the contract creator](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/template/examples/contract-erc20/truffle/contracts/MyToken.sol#L8).
Use the `Chain State` app to query `evm > accountStorage` and view the value associated with Alice's
account in the `_balances` map of the ERC-20 contract; use the ERC-20 contract address
(`0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f`) as the first parameter and the storage slot to read
as the second parameter (`0x045c0350b9cf0df39c4b40400c965118df2dca5ce0fbcf0de4aafc099aea4a14`). The
value that is returned should be
`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.

The storage slot was calculated using
[a provided utility](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/master/template/utils/README.md#--erc20-slot-slot-address). (Slot 0 and alice address:
`0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558`)

### Contract Usage

Use the `Developer` -> `Extrinsics` tab to invoke the `transfer(address, uint256)` function on the
ERC-20 contract with `evm > call` and transfer some of the ERC-20 tokens from Alice to Bob.

```text
target: 0x8a50db1e0f9452cfd91be8dc004ceb11cb08832f
source: 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558
input: 0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000008eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc528761369300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dd
value: 0
gas_limit: 4294967295
gas_price: 1
```

The value of the `input` parameter is an EVM ABI-encoded function call that was calculated using
[the Remix web IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org); it consists of a function selector (`0xa9059cbb`)
and the arguments to be used for the function invocation. In this case, the arguments correspond to
Bob's EVM account ID (`0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693`) and the number of tokens to be
transferred (`0xdd`, or 221 in hex).

### Check Bob Contract Storage

After the extrinsic has finalized, use the `Chain State` app to query `evm > accountStorage` to see
the ERC-20 balances for both Alice and Bob.
