##  Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn and practice how to start a blockchain network with a
validator/authority set of your choosing using Substrate.

You should already have version `v3.0.0` of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
compiled on your computer from when you completed the
[Create Your First Substrate Chain Tutorial](../../tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/).
If you do not, please complete that tutorial.
