In this hands-on workshop, participants will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain), register
parachains, make cross-chain asset transfers, and convert their own Substrate runtimes to parachains
using Cumulus. The workshop is divided into 3 parts. At the end of this workshop, you will have learnt the process of 
connecting any Substrate based chain to a relay chain and how to interact with it in a local test network. 

To learn more about parachains before continuing this workshop,

### Learning Outcomes

- Set up your parachain building environment 
- Start a relay chain

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

In this workshop, we will be using [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template). Compiling this project is a resource intensive
process! We suggest compiling and running the Parachain template on a machine with **no less than**:

- 8 GB of RAM (16 is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 is suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space

Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely to _run out of memory resulting in a `SIGKILL`
error_. This generally happens on the `polkadot-service` build so be sure to _monitor your RAM
usage_ (with something like [`htop`](https://htop.dev/)) and look out as swap memory starting to be
used.

<Message

  title={`Tip`}
  text={`
If you cannot find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solution which trades longer build
time for more limited memory usage.
- Use less threads: cargo's \`-j\` flag specifies the number of threads to use to build. Try to use one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo's [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds, with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.
\`\`\`bash
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1
\`\`\`
`}
/>

### Software Version

At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain's codebase they are
connecting to. If you want to connect your parachian to a running relay network like the
[Rococo](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#testing-a-parachain-rococo-testnet) test network, you _must_ be
sure that you are testing against the exact same build of that relay chain.

This workshop has been tested on commits:

- **Polkadot** tagged [**`v0.9.8`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.8)
- **Parachain Template** tagged [**`polkadot-v0.9.8`**](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.8)
- **Polkadot-JS Apps** tagged [**`v0.94.1`**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/v0.94.1).
  It is generally expected that the [hosted Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) should work. If you have issues, build and run this UI yourself, at this tagged version.

  title={`Warning`}
  text={`You **must** use these exact versions to ensure that you do not run into conflicts.
  Parachain development is actively making breaking changes between commits on these
  repositories.`}
/>

We're doing our best to keep the parachain template and this workshop updated presently
with the latest release of Polkadot. Please check with us in the [Parachain Technical matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#parachain-technical:matrix.parity.io)
when breaking changes and testnet resets occur.

for the Chinese content translation!

### Disclaimer

**Cumulus is pre-release software that is still under development.** While this workshop strives to
be useful, the material it covers may change or break before Cumulus is fully released. Nothing
presented here is ready for use in value-bearing blockchains!

## Build Environment & Compilation

This workshop covers the entire process of launching a relay chain, connecting parachains,
transferring assets between chains, and developing your own parachain runtimes. Naturally, there
will be some significant compiling if you intend to build everything yourself.

Compiling the Polkadot and parachain template nodes can be avoided if you prefer to use the
Docker images.

### Setup Local Development Environment

Follow the instructions here to [setup a local development environment](/v3/getting-started/overview)
for Substrate.

### Building the Polkadot Relay Chain Node

Clone the Polkadot repository, and build the node. We are using a
[specific git tag](/#2-software-version) for this workshop. Perform these steps in your typical
workspace directory.

```bash
# Clone the Polkadot Repository
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git

# Switch into the Polkadot directory
cd polkadot

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout v0.9.8

# Build the relay chain Node
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/polkadot --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Polkadot node.

For the rest of this workshop, we will refer to this binary simply as `polkadot`.

### Building the Parachain Template

We will use the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template">Parachain Template </ExternalLink>
(similar to the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template">Node Template </ExternalLink>
to launch our first parachain and make cross-chain asset transfers. Later, we will
use it as the starting point for developing our own parachains. Perform these steps in your typical
workspace directory.

```bash
# Clone the Parachain Template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the Parachain Template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout polkadot-v0.9.8

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/parachain-collator --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Cumulus-based parachain collator.

For the rest of this workshop we will refer to it simply as `parachain-collator`.

## Relay Chain Specification

You will need a chain specification ([chain spec](/v3/runtime/chain-specs))
for your relay chain network. You can use one that is [included with this workshop](/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json), or create your own.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Important`}
  text={`Keep in mind to always have one or more relay chain validator node running than
  your connected parachains. For example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more
  relay chain validator nodes.`}
/>

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.
These _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder that is published in your node's codebase for others to use. As an example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res"> here </ExternalLink>
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res"> here </ExternalLink>

  text={`If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the

This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1\)
in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.
`}
/> 

### Chain Specification

For just checking if things work, we suggest you use one of the [precompiled raw](#_1a-using-a-prebuilt-chain-spec)
chain spec we have included for you. If you want to customize your network, jump to [Create Your Chain Spec](#_1b-create-your-own-chain-spec) section.

In either case, if you use a **plain** chain spec (human readable) you want to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to
use when starting your nodes. Jump to the [Conversion](#_2-convert-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

#### Option 1: Using a Prebuilt Chain Spec

This workshop contains three chain spec files that you can use **without modification** for a
local test network:

- [rococo-custom-2-raw.json](/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json)
  : A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering
  a single parachain. Plain chain spec: [rococo-custom-2-plain.json](/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json)

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json">
    shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json
  </a>
  : A three-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie
  as the third validator. Plain chain spec <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-plain.json">
    included
  </a>
  .

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json">
    shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json
  </a>
  : A four-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie and
  Dave as the third and fourth validators. Plain chain spec <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-plain.json">
    included
  </a>
  .

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. They
can also be used to derive a [new custom raw chain spec](#adjust-the-chain-spec).

These specs were created according to the steps in the next section. If you would like even more
validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other ways, keep reading, otherwise
[start your relay chain](#starting-the-relay-chain) with a raw chain spec file.

#### Option 2: Create Your Own Chain Spec

As with any Substrate chains, you can always create your own chain spec file. It is generally best
to start from an existing specification (option 1 above) to minimize chances of error. Once you are
familiar with the overall flow, use the following steps to customize and generate your own chain
specs.

##### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

That file contains most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so
we just need to add an authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of
the generated spec file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well known accounts used
in other tutorials (Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"session": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)
        "im_online": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_validator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_assignment": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "authority_discovery": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "beefy": "KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL",               // <---- The BEEFY *encoded* ecdsa session keys (//Alice)
       }
    ]
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
  ]
}
```

### Adjust the Chain Spec

Add your new authority's `AccountId` and `ValidatorId`.

In this runtime configuration, both IDs are the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the
[well-known development accounts](/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

> All the keys and addresses needed can be generated using either:
>
> - The [`subkey` tool](/v3/tools/subkey) (v2.0.1 and above for BEEFY keys)
> - The node `key` subcommand. (this can be your `polkadot` or `parachain-collator` binary, based on the latest substrate)

Polkadot **validator authority** address for `//Alice//stash` (`sr25519` cryptography):

```bash
# Replace `node` with any substrate based node binary, like `polkadot`
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice//stash
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice//stash` is account:
  Secret seed:       0x3c881bc4d45926680c64a7f9315eeda3dd287f8d598f3653d7c107799c5422b3
  Public key (hex):  0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  Public key (SS58): 5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
  Account ID:        0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  SS58 Address:      5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
```

Polkadot **grandpa session** key for `//Alice` (`ed25519` cryptography):

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ed25519 --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xabf8e5bdbe30c65656c0a3cbd181ff8a56294a69dfedd27982aace4a76909115
  Public key (hex):  0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  Public key (SS58): 5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
  Account ID:        0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  SS58 Address:      5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
```

Polkadot address for `//Alice` (`sr25519` cryptography). This is used in all but the `beefy`
key sections of the chain spec after the `grandpa` key.

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a
  Public key (hex):  0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  Public key (SS58): 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
  Account ID:        0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  SS58 Address:      5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xcb6df9de1efca7a3998a8ead4e02159d5fa99c3e0d4fd6432667390bb4726854
  Public key (hex):  0x020a1091341fe5664bfa1782d5e04779689068c916b04cb365ec3153755684d9a1
  Public key (SS58): KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL
  Account ID:        0x01e552298e47454041ea31273b4b630c64c104e4514aa3643490b8aaca9cf8ed
  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys (see [the note below](#ss58-encoding-of-key-vs-address) on why).

Now that you have all the keys you need, append them in the `palletSession` section of you _plain_ spec file.
You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this same process.

### Convert Plain to Raw Chain Spec

Now that you've modified your chain spec, you can generate the final raw spec file.

> Your final spec _must_ start with the word `rococo` or the node will not know what runtime logic
> to include.

```bash
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this warning for
now.

#### SS58 Encoding of Key vs. Address
  
  In the case of sr25519 and ed25519, the account ID matches its public key, hence SS58 encoded
  account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding. In case of ECDSA, we apply blake2 algorithm to the public key to get the address (due to the size
  difference between 33 vs 32 bytes), so the SS58 encoding is different. 
  
  Default serialization / deserialization implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding,
  hence every time we use public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A
  notable case is chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).

<Message

  title={`Note`}
  text={`The addition of custom session keys in the plain chain spec is not needed for **production chains**,
as these are generated for you in the included chain spec files in \`node/service/res\` folder.
The exercise above is used because you are recompiling your node for just adding authorities in this case.
So if all you need to do is configure minor things off of a known base chain spec, as we did, you will want
to set the information in \`chain-spec.rs\`, and generate the binary and finally use the CLI to generate
your custom chain spec.`}

TODO
self-note: This part seems appear a bit out of context, and suddenly jump to the code implementation
level.

### Session Keys

The [`impl_opaque_keys!`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/runtime/src/traits.rs#L1186-L1321)
macro implements [`Keys`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/session/src/lib.rs#L386)
that is [used in Rococo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L173-L183)
to actually [generate all the keys](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L1117-L1127).
This ingests the keys you set in your
[chain_spec.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L174-L192)
file for you when you _compile your runtime_ based on what you configure
[in this section](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L656) of that file.

The BEEFY key is encoded, this is derived in the [polkadot launch CLI tool](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch/blob/89e9704c8addd7f4dffa7cc75236393fd8c80bab/src/spec.ts#L68) using the [@polkadot-js/util-crypto](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util-crypto) node package [here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/blob/e7e82443231b75b7a546b462a63385db82a57f36/packages/keyring/src/pair/index.ts#L115) as a [SS58 encoded key](/v3/advanced/ss58) of the form:

```
base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
```

Fortunately, `subkey` and the `node key` subcommand will generate this for you! So no need to
worry about the details any more here.

## Starting the Relay Chain

Before we can attach any cumulus-based parachains, we need to launch a relay chain to connect to.
This page describes in detail how to start both nodes using the two-validator `rococo-custom-2-raw.json`
chain spec that ships with this workshop as well as the general instructions for starting additional
nodes.

### Start Alice's Node

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
polkadot \
--alice \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay/alice \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9944
```

The port and websocket port specified here are the defaults and thus those flags can be omitted.
However we've chosen to leave them in to enforce the habit of checking their values. Because Alice
is using the defaults, no other nodes on the relay chain or parachains can use these ports.

When the node starts you will see several log messages. **Take note of the node's Peer ID**
in the logs. We will need it when connecting other nodes to it. It will look something like
this:

```bash
🏷 Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGjsmVmZCM1jPtVNp6hRbbkGBK3LADYNniJAKJ19NUYiq
```

### Start Bob's Node

```bash
polkadot \
--bob \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-bob \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30334 \
--ws-port 9945
```

Bob's command is perfectly analogous to Alice's. It differs concretely from Alice's in that Bob has
specified his own base path, provided his own validator keys (`--bob`), and used his own ports.
Finally he has added a `--bootnodes` flag. This bootnodes flag is not strictly necessary if you are
running the entire network on a single local system, but it is necessary when operating over the
network, so I've chosen to leave it in.

### Starting Additional Validators (Optional)

> If you are using the `rococo-custom-2-raw.json` spec, you do not need to start additional nodes.

If you're using the `rococo-custom-3-raw.json` or `rococo-custom-4-raw.json` specs that ship with this workshop you will
need to start one or two more nodes. Again, this command is entirely analogous. You just need to
make sure that nodes on the same physical system do not have conflicting ports or base paths.

```bash
polkadot \
--charlie \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-charlie \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30335 \
--ws-port 9946
```

If your custom chain spec includes self-generated keys, see the
[Substrate private network tutorial](/tutorials/v3/private-network#add-keys-to-keystore)
for details on inserting these keys.
