## Modifying the Template Pallet

The Parachain Template comes with a template pallet at `pallets/template` just like the Node
Template.

Modify this pallet by adding storage items.

Follow the [PoE tutorial](../../tutorials/proof-of-existence). Although it was
written for the node template, it works effectively identically here.

## Adding an External Pallet

<!-- TODO: add more content and gotchas about pallets in the para-context -->

**Note:** This section is a _work in progress_ and will be fleshed out later.

Add substrate's `nicks` pallet to your runtime.

**Remember to match substrate commits exactly in your dependencies!**

Reference the [**Add a Pallet** tutorial](../../tutorials/add-a-pallet/) for
inspiration.
