## Overview

## Steps
### 1. Modifying the Template Pallet

The Parachain Template comes with a template pallet at `pallets/template` just like the Node
Template.

Modify this pallet by adding storage items.

Follow the [PoE tutorial](/v3/tutorials/proof-of-existence). Although it was
written for the node template, it works effectively identically here.

### 2. Adding an External Pallet

<!-- TODO: add more content and gotchas about pallets in the para-context -->

**Note:** This section is a _work in progress_ and will be fleshed out later.

Add substrate's `nicks` pallet to your runtime.

**Remember to match substrate commits exactly in your dependencies!**

Reference the [**Add a Pallet** tutorial](v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet) for
inspiration.
