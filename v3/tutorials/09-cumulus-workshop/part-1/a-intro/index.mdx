## Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, participants will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain), register
parachains, make cross-chain asset transfers, and convert their own Substrate runtimes to parachains
using Cumulus.

  If you are here _without_ any former Substrate experience, you are likely to not understand or
complete this tutorial. Before you continue please complete the following tutorials:
  - [Create Your First Substrate Chain](../../v3/tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain)
  - [Start a Private Network](../../v3/tutorials/private-network)
  
  We will reference these assuming you have already understand all the steps involved, and
have your machine configured to compile Substrate-based projects.

## Hardware Requirements

In this workshop, we will be using [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template). Compiling this project is a resource intensive
process! We suggest compiling and running the Parachain template on a machine with **no less than**:

- 8 GB of RAM (16 is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 is suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space

Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely to _run out of memory resulting in a `SIGKILL`
error_. This generally happens on the `polkadot-service` build so be sure to _monitor your RAM
usage_ (with something like [`htop`](https://htop.dev/)) and look out as swap memory starting to be
used.

  title={`Tip`}
  text={`
If you cannot find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solution which trades longer build
time for more limited memory usage.
- Use less threads: cargo's \`-j\` flag specifies the number of threads to use to build. Try to use one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo's [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds, with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.
\`\`\`bash
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1
\`\`\`

## Software Version

At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain's codebase they are
connecting to. If you want to connect your parachian to a running relay network like the
[Rococo](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-parachains-rococo) test network, you _must_ be
sure that you are testing against the exact same build of that relay chain.

This workshop has been tested on commits:

- **Polkadot** tagged [**`v0.9.8`**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.8)
- **Parachain Template** tagged [**`polkadot-v0.9.8`**](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.8)
- **Polkadot-JS Apps** tagged [**`v0.94.1`**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/v0.94.1).
  It is generally expected that the [hosted Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) should work. If you have issues, build and run this UI yourself, at this tagged version.

  text={`You **must** use these exact versions to ensure that you do not run into conflicts.
  Parachain development is actively making breaking changes between commits on these
  repositories.`}

We're doing our best to keep the parachain template and this workshop updated presently
with the latest release of Polkadot. Please check with us in the [Parachain Technical matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#parachain-technical:matrix.parity.io)
when breaking changes and testnet resets occur.
