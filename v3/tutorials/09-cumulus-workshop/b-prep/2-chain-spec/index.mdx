title: Relay Chain Chain Specifcation
slug: /tutorials/v3/cumulus-workshop/relay-spec
---

You will need a chain specification (chain spec)
for your relay chain network. You can use one that is included with this workshop, or create your own.

> **Note**: Keep in mind to always have one or more relay chain validator node running than
> your connected parachains. For example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more
> relay chain validator nodes.

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.
These _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder that is published in your node's codebase for others to use. As an example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain spec files [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain spec files [here](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res)

> If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the
> associated chain spec for your network generated once and distributed to your peers.
>
> This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1)
> in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.

For just checking if things work, we suggest you use one of the [precompiled raw](#_1a-using-a-prebuilt-chain-spec)
chain spec we have included for you. If you want to customize your network, jump to [Create Your Chain Spec](#_1b-create-your-own-chain-spec) section.

In either case, if you use a **plain** chain spec (human readable) you want to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to
use when starting your nodes. Jump to the [Conversion](#_2-convert-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

## Option 1: Using a Prebuilt Chain Spec

This workshop contains three chain spec files that you can use **without modification** for a
local test network:

<!-- for some reason these links can't be markdown. See https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/cumulus-workshop/issues/16 -->

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json">
    shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json
  </a>
  : A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering
  a single parachain. Plain chain spec <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-plain.json">
    included
  </a>
  .

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json">
    shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json
  </a>
  : A three-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie
  as the third validator. Plain chain spec <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-plain.json">
    included
  </a>
  .

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json">
    shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json
  </a>
  : A four-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie and
  Dave as the third and fourth validators. Plain chain spec <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-plain.json">
    included
  </a>
  .

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. They
can also be used to derive a [new custom raw chain spec](#adjust-the-chain-spec).

These specs were created according to the steps in the next section. If you would like even more
validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other ways, keep reading, otherwise
[start your relay chain](en/2-relay-chain/1-launch) with a raw chain spec file.

## Option 2: Create Your Own Chain Spec

As with any Substrate chains, you can always create your own chain spec file. It is generally best
to start from an existing specification (option 1 above) to minimize chances of error. Once you are
familiar with the overall flow, use the following steps to customize and generate your own chain
specs.

### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

That file contains most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so
we just need to add an authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of
the generated spec file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well known accounts used
in other tutorials (Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"session": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)
        "im_online": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_validator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_assignment": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "authority_discovery": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "beefy": "KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL",               // <---- The BEEFY *encoded* ecdsa session keys (//Alice)
       }
    ]
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
  ]
}
```

### Adjust the Chain Spec

Add your new authority's `AccountId` and `ValidatorId`.

In this runtime configuration, both IDs are the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the
[well-known development accounts](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

> All the keys and addresses needed can be generated using either:
>
> - The [`subkey` tool](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey) (v2.0.1 and above for BEEFY keys)
> - The node `key` subcommand. (this can be your `polkadot` or `parachain-collator` binary, based on the latest substrate)

Polkadot **validator authority** address for `//Alice//stash` (`sr25519` cryptography):

```bash
# Replace `node` with any substrate based node binary, like `polkadot`
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice//stash
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice//stash` is account:
  Secret seed:       0x3c881bc4d45926680c64a7f9315eeda3dd287f8d598f3653d7c107799c5422b3
  Public key (hex):  0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  Public key (SS58): 5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
  Account ID:        0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  SS58 Address:      5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
```

Polkadot **grandpa session** key for `//Alice` (`ed25519` cryptography):

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ed25519 --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xabf8e5bdbe30c65656c0a3cbd181ff8a56294a69dfedd27982aace4a76909115
  Public key (hex):  0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  Public key (SS58): 5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
  Account ID:        0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  SS58 Address:      5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
```

Polkadot address for `//Alice` (`sr25519` cryptography). This is used in all but the `beefy`
key sections of the chain spec after the `grandpa` key.

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a
  Public key (hex):  0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  Public key (SS58): 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
  Account ID:        0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  SS58 Address:      5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xcb6df9de1efca7a3998a8ead4e02159d5fa99c3e0d4fd6432667390bb4726854
  Public key (hex):  0x020a1091341fe5664bfa1782d5e04779689068c916b04cb365ec3153755684d9a1
  Public key (SS58): KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL
  Account ID:        0x01e552298e47454041ea31273b4b630c64c104e4514aa3643490b8aaca9cf8ed
  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys (see [the note below](#ss58-encoding-of-key-vs-address) on why).

> Phew! That was a lot of keys! To learn more about _why and how_ these are used, see the
> [session keys](session-keys) section below.

Now that you have all the keys you need, append them in the `palletSession` section of you _plain_ spec file.
You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this same process.

### Convert Plain to Raw Chain Spec

Now that you've modified your chain spec, you can generate the final raw spec file.

> Your final spec _must_ start with the word `rococo` or the node will not know what runtime logic
> to include.

```bash
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this warning for
now.

## Further Resources

The addition of custom session keys in the plain chain spec is not needed for **production chains**,
as these are generated for you in the included chain spec files in `node/service/res` folder.
The exercise above is used because you are recompiling your node for just adding authorities in this case.
So if all you need to do is configure minor things off of a know base chain spec, as we did, you will want
to set the information in `chain-spec.rs`, and generate the binary and finally use the CLI to generate
your custom chain spec.

### Chain Specification

To learn more beyond what we did and more on what can be configured, check out the
[**chain spec** KB article](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/chain-spec)

<!--

self-note: This part seems appear a bit out of context, and suddently jump to the code implementation
level.

### Session Keys

The [`impl_opaque_keys!`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/runtime/src/traits.rs#L1186-L1321)
macro implements [`Keys`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/session/src/lib.rs#L386)
that is [used in Rococo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L173-L183)
to actually [generate all the keys](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L1117-L1127).
This ingests the keys you set in your
[chain_spec.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L174-L192)
file for you when you _compile your runtime_ based on what you configure
[in this section](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L656) of that file.

The BEEFY key is encoded, this is derived in the [polkadot launch CLI tool](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch/blob/89e9704c8addd7f4dffa7cc75236393fd8c80bab/src/spec.ts#L68) using the [@polkadot-js/util-crypto](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util-crypto) node package [here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/blob/e7e82443231b75b7a546b462a63385db82a57f36/packages/keyring/src/pair/index.ts#L115) as a [SS58 encoded key](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/ss58-address-format) of the form:

```
base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
```

Fortunately, `subkey` and the `node key` subcommand will generate this for you! So no need to
worry about the details any more here.

### SS58 Encoding of Key vs. Address

In case of sr25519 and ed25519 crypto, the account ID matches its public key, hence SS58 encoded
account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding.

In case of ECDSA, we apply blake2 algorithm to the public key to get the address (due to the size
difference between 33 vs 32 bytes), so the SS58 encoding is different.

Default serialization / deserialization implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding,
hence every time we use public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A
notable case is chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).
