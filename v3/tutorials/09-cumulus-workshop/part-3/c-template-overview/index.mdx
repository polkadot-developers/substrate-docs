## Overview

Substrate developers who are familiar with the
<ExternalLink url={`https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template`}>Substrate Node Template</ExternalLink> will
find the <ExternalLink url={`https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template`}>Substrate Parachain Template </ExternalLink>
familiar. They have the same general structure featuring `node`, `runtime`, and `pallets`
directories. Their runtimes are similar and feature many of the same pallets. Apart from a few new
traits, the `pallet-template` itself is essentially identical. Many of the [Substrate devhub tutorials](/tutorials/v3)
can be used with few modifications on the Parachain Template.

The similarities between these two templates should give you confidence, that if you've built a
Substrate chain, you will have no problem building a parachain!

## Steps
### 1. Differences from the Node Template

There are, however, a few important differences between the two templates that are worth observing at
the outset.

#### Parachain Info Pallet

This pallet is designed to inject information about the parachain's registration into its own
runtime. Currently it just injects the Para ID that the chain is registered at. This allows the
runtime to know which cross-chain messages are intended for it.

#### Message Broker Pallet

This pallet is responsible for distributing cross-chain messages received over the network to the
pallets that they are intended for. If you intend to receive cross chain messages, you should use
this pallet.

#### `register_validate_block!` Macro

Each parachain must supply a `validate_block` function, expressed as a Wasm blob, to the relay chain
when registering. The node template does not provide this function, but the parachain template does.
Thanks to cumulus, creating this function for a Substrate runtime is as simple as adding one line of
code at the bottom of your runtime:

```rust
cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::register_validate_block!(
  Runtime = Runtime,
  BlockExecutor = cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::BlockExecutor::<Runtime, Executive>,
  CheckInherents = CheckInherents,
);
```

#### No GRANDPA Pallet

Many popular Substrate runtimes including the node template feature a finality-related GRANDPA
pallet and its associated `GrandpaApi`. These are both missing from the parachain template.

This is because parachains follow the finality of the relay chain rather than running their own
finality gadget. This is fundamental to Polkadot's architecture and will not change.

#### Service

The collator's service is entirely different from the node template's. While you can find
similarities, the structure of the service is much different. This new service is the primary change
that cumulus provides.

### 2. Using the Template

  The instructions in the following sections walk through a few basic exercises using the parachain
  template. They may be followed in any order and do not build on one another.
  They assume that you have already
  [compiled the Parachain Template](../1-prep/1-compiling.md) on your local system. If you haven't,
  please go back and do that.
  `}
/>

The Parachain Template comes with a template pallet at `pallets/template` just like the Node
Template.

Modify this pallet by adding storage items.

Follow the [PoE tutorial](/tutorials/v3/proof-of-existence). Although it was
written for the node template, it works effectively identically here.

### 3. Adding an External Pallet

<!-- TODO: add more content and gotchas about pallets in the para-context -->

**Note:** This section is a _work in progress_ and will be fleshed out later.

Add Substrate's `nicks` pallet to your runtime.

**Remember to match substrate commits exactly in your dependencies!**

Reference the [**Add a Pallet** tutorial](v3/tutorials/add-a-pallet) for
inspiration.
