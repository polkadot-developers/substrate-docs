title: Launching a Parachain
slug: /v3/tutorials/cumulus-workshop/para-launch
---

We'll begin by deploying [Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template)
with Para ID `2000`. These instructions are written specifically for Para ID 2000.

The `parachain-collator` binary used below comes from compiling the Parachain Template successfully.
Refer to [Building the Parachain Template](en/1-prep/1-compiling?id=building-the-parachain-template)
section for details.

## Generate Parachain Genesis State

To register a parachain, the relay chain needs to know the parachain's genesis state. The collator
node can export that state to a file for us. The following command will create a file containing the
parachain's entire genesis state, hex-encoded.

```bash
parachain-collator export-genesis-state --parachain-id 2000 > para-2000-genesis
```

## Obtain Wasm Runtime Validation Function

The relay chain also needs the parachain-specific runtime validation logic to validate
parachain blocks. The collator node also has a command to produce this Wasm blob:

```bash
parachain-collator export-genesis-wasm > para-2000-wasm
```

> The Wasm blob does not depend on the Para ID, so we do not provide that flag. If you are
> launching multiple parachains using the exact same runtime, you do not need to regenerate the Wasm
> blob each time.

> This is for the _genesis_ block only. You cannot, at this time, connect a parachian with any
> previous state to a relay chain. All parachains must start from block 0 on the relay chain.

## Start the Collator Node

We can now start the collator node with the following command. Notice that we need to supply the same
relay chain spec we used when launching relay chain nodes, at the second half of the command.

```bash
# NOTE: this command assumes a Para ID of 2000. Change as needed.
parachain-collator \
--alice \
--collator \
--force-authoring \
--parachain-id 2000 \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/alice \
--port 40333 \
--ws-port 8844 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain <relay chain spec json> \
--port 30343 \
--ws-port 9977
```

The first thing to notice about this command is that several arguments are passed before the lone
`--`, and several more arguments passed after it. A cumulus collator contains the actual
collator node and also an **embedded relay chain node**. The arguments before the `--` are for the
collator, and the arguments after the `--` are for the embedded relay chain node.

We give the collator a base path and ports as we did for the relay chain node previously. We also
specify the Para ID.

Remember to change the collator-specific values if you are executing these instructions a second
time for a second parachain. You will use the same relay chain chain spec, but need different ports
exposed.

Currently, a parachain node runs both a parachain collator (or full node) tightly coupled with a relay chain full node in the same process.
There is presently no way to run a parachain node without the embedded relay chain node, but it is expected
that this will become possible for non-collator nodes eventually.

## Is It Working?

At this point your _collator's logs_ should look something like this:

You should see your collator node running (alone) and peering with the already
running relay chain nodes. It has not start authoring parachain blocks yet.
Authoring will begin when the collator is actually **registered on the relay chain**.
