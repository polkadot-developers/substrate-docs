[Substrate Connect](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-connect/) is
a JavaScript library that builds on the [Polkadot JS
API](/v3/integration/polkadot-js#polkadot-js-api) to enable developers to build application
specific light clients for Substrate chains. By using light clients available to all
Substrate built blockchains, application developers no longer need to rely on single RPC
nodes to allow end-users to interact with their applications. This introduces
a new paradigm for decentralization: instead of specifying a centralized RPC node, developers
just need to specify the blockchain's [chain specification](/v3/runtime/chain-specs) for
their application to synchronize with the chain.

In addition to the Substrate Connect JavaScript library, Substrate Connect is also a browser extension that the library can leverage. 
The Substrate Connect browser extension is targeted at end users.

## What it enables

The Substrate Connect JavaScript library provides application developers ways to run a Substrate light client in any NodeJS environment, from in-browser applications and extensions, to Electron apps, IOT devices, and mobile phones.

For in-browser end-users, the Substrate Connect library can connect to the Substrate Connect browser extension in order to provide better loading times, better chain connectivity, and optimized resources usage.

## Motivation

Interacting with a Substrate chain via an RPC server requires a layer of third party trust which
can be avoided. Substrate Connect uses a Wasm light client which connects to a Substrate chain
without any unecessary intermediary.

In addition, due to browser limitations on websockets from HTTPS pages, establishing a good number of peers
is difficult as nodes are reachable only if they provide a TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate.
Substrate Connect provides a browser extension to overcome this limitation and to keep the chains synced in
the background, making applications on a Substrate chain faster.

## How it works

The library and extension run a light client, [Smoldot](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot), that manages connecting to different blockchains. 
Whenever a user opens an app in a new browser tab it asks the extension to connect to whatever blockchains the app is interested in.
If the browser extension is installed, the same light client is shared between all browser tabs, meaning that it will only connect to a network once even if there are multiple apps talking to it.

The [`@substrate/connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect) library has the following
capabilities:

- It detects whether a user has the Substrate Connect browser extension installed. If it
  isn't installed, it falls back to instantiating a light client directly in the page.

- It implements the same JSON-RPC API as regular RPC nodes, enabling the use of the [Polkadot JS API](/v3/integration/polkadot-js#polkadot-js-api) on top of it.
