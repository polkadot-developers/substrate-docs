[Substrate Connect](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-connect/) is
a JavaScript library that enables developers to build application specific light
clients for Substrate chains. It provides a more secure alternative than connecting to
a JSON-RPC node to interact with the chain. 

Substrate Connect builds on the [Polkadot JS API](/v3/integration/polkadot-js#polkadot-js-api) 
so building an app has the same experience as with using a traditional RPC server node. Its 
components are also part of the Substrate building framework and available for every Substrate
based project.

## What it enables

Substrate Connect provides the necessary infrastructure to run a Substrate light client in any
Javascript or Node environment, from in-browser applications and extensions, to Electron apps,
IOT devices, and mobile phones.

Substrate Connect enables Substrate runtime engineers to:

-  Generate a light client of their chain in a single command.
-  Run light nodes of different chains including their own custom chains 

For in-browser use, Substrate Connect provides a Browser Extension designed to give end-users the 
ability to contain all running light clients in one browser tab. In addition, it provides:

1. **Ready-to-use Substrate Wasm Light-Clients to be executed in the browser.** Wasm light clients are 
part of the Substrate framework and with that, available for every Substrate based project. If developers
want to generate a light client of their chain, all it takes is just one command to compile a
library that contains everything that's needed to run a light client in the browser.

2. **An npm module that bundles the light-clients of different chains.** It provides an interface
that allows developers to run light nodes of different chains and to modify the chain specification
of their own chain.

## Motivation

Interacting with a Substrate chain via an RPC server requires a layer of 3rd party trust which
can be avoided. Substrate Connect uses a Wasm light client which connects to a Substrate chain
without any unecessary intermediary.

In addition, due to browser limitations on websockets from HTTPS pages, establishing a good number of peers
is difficult as nodes are reachable only if they provide a TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate. Substrate
Connect provides a browser extension to overcome this limitation and to keep the chains synced in
the background, making applications on a Substrate chain faster.

## How it works

The extension runs a single light client, [Smoldot](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot) that
manages connecting to different blockchains. Whenever a user opens an app in a new browser tab it
asks the extension to connect to whatever blockchains the app is interested in. The light client is
smart enough to share resources so that it only connects to a network once even if there are
multiple apps talking to it.

The `@substrate/connect` API has the following capabilities:

- It can detect whether a user has the Substrate Connect browser extension installed. If it 
isn't installed, it falls back to instantiating a light client directly in the page.

- It handles receiving and listening for messages from the browser extension and provider.

- It manages an app's connection to multiple blockchains, creating an instance of Smoldot 
and connecting the app to it.

### Usage

When used in individual projects, the Substrate Connect node module will first check for the
installed extension. If available, it will try to connect to the light client running inside the
extension. Only if the extension is not installed will it start a light client in the browser tab.

### Ways to use it 

When building an app with Substrate Connect, it will detect whether the user has the extension and
use it, or create the WASM light client in-page for them. If developers want to generate a light
client of their chain, all it takes is just one command to compile a library that contains
everything needed to run a light client in the browser.
