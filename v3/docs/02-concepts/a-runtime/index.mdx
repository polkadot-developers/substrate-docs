The runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behavior. In Substrate-based
chains, the runtime is referred to as the
"[state transition function](/v3/getting-started/glossary#state-transition-function-stf)";
it is where Substrate developers define the storage items that are used to represent the
blockchain's [state](/v3/getting-started/glossary#state) as well as the
[functions](/v3/concepts/extrinsics) that allow blockchain users to make
changes to this state.

Each Substrate node contains a runtime. The runtime contains the business logic of the chain. It 
defines what transactions are valid and invalid and determines how the chain's state changes in 
response to transactions. The "outer node", everything other than the runtime, does not compile 
to Wasm, only to native. The outer node is responsible for handling peer discovery, transaction 
pooling, block and transaction gossiping, consensus, and answering RPC calls from the outside 
world. While performing these tasks, the outer node sometimes needs to query the runtime for 
information, or provide information to the runtime. A Runtime API facilitates this kind of 
communication between the outer node and the runtime. 

## Runtime APIs

In Substrate, the `sp_api` crate provides an interface to implement a runtime API. It is designed to give 
developers the ability to define their own custom runtime APIs using the [`impl_runtime_apis`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_api/macro.impl_runtime_apis.html) 
macro. However, every runtime must implement the [`Core`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_api/trait.Core.html) and 
[`Metadata`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_api/trait.Metadata.html) runtime APIs. In addition to these, a basic Substrate Node
has the following runtime APIs implemented:
- [`BlockBuilder`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_block_builder/trait.BlockBuilder.html): Provides the functionality required for building a block.
- [`TaggedTransactionQueue`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_transaction_pool/runtime_api/trait.TaggedTransactionQueue.html): Handles validating transactions in the transaction queue.
- [`OffchainWorkerApi`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_offchain/trait.OffchainWorkerApi.html): Handles [off-chain capabilities](/v3/concepts/off-chain-features).
- [`AuraApi`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_consensus_aura/trait.AuraApi.html): Handles block authorship with [Aura consensus](/v3/advanced/consensus#aura).
- [`SessionKeys`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_session/trait.SessionKeys.html): Generates and decodes [session keys](/v3/concepts/session-keys).
- [`GrandpaApi`](/rustdocs/latest/sp_finality_grandpa/trait.GrandpaApi.html): Integrates the [GRANDPA](/v3/advanced/consensus#grandpa) finality gadget into the runtime.
- [`AccountNonceApi`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_system_rpc_runtime_api/trait.AccountNonceApi.html): Handles querying transaction indices.
- [`TransactionPaymentApi`](/rustdocs/latest/pallet_transaction_payment_rpc_runtime_api/trait.TransactionPaymentApi.html): Handles querying information about transactions.
- [`Benchmark`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_benchmarking/trait.Benchmark.html): Provides a way to [benchmark](/v3/runtime/benchmarking) a FRAME runtime.


In order to provide its defining forkless runtime upgrade capabilities, Substrate runtimes
are built as [WebAssembly (Wasm)](/v3/getting-started/glossary#webassembly-wasm)
bytecode. Substrate also defines the core primitives that the runtime must implement.

## Core primitives

The Substrate framework makes minimal assumptions about what your runtime must provide to the other
layers of Substrate. But there are a few data types need to be defined and must fulfill a particular
interface in order to work within the Substrate framework.

They are:

- `Hash`: A type which encodes a cryptographic digest of some data. Typically just a 256-bit
  quantity.

- `DigestItem`: A type which must be able to encode one of a number of "hard-wired" alternatives
  relevant to consensus and change-tracking as well as any number of "soft-coded" variants, relevant
  to specific modules within the runtime.

- `Digest`: A series of DigestItems. This encodes all information that is relevant for a
  light-client to have on hand within the block.

- `Extrinsic`: A type to represent a single piece of data external to the blockchain that is
  recognized by the blockchain. This typically involves one or more signatures, and some sort of
  encoded instructions (e.g. for transferring ownership of funds or calling into a smart contract).

- `Header`: A type which is representative (cryptographically or otherwise) of all information
  relevant to a block. It includes the parent hash, the storage root and the extrinsics trie root,
  the digest and a block number.

- `Block`: Essentially just a combination of `Header` and a series of `Extrinsic`s, together with a
  specification of the hashing algorithm to be used.

- `BlockNumber`: A type which encodes the total number of ancestors any valid block has. Typically a
  32-bit quantity.

## FRAME primitives

The core Substrate codebase ships with [FRAME](/v3/runtime/frame), Parity's system
for Substrate runtime development that is used for chains like
[Kusama](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/kusama/src/lib.rs) and
[Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/polkadot/src/lib.rs). FRAME
defines additional runtime primitives and
provides a framework that makes it easy to construct a runtime by composing modules, called
[pallets](/v3/runtime/frame#pallets). Each pallet encapsulates domain-specific logic that is
expressed as a set of a [storage items](/v3/runtime/storage),
[events](/v3/runtime/events-and-errors),
[errors](/v3/runtime/events-and-errors#errors), and
[dispatchable functions](/v3/getting-started/glossary#dispatch). FRAME developers
can [create their own pallets](/v3/runtime/frame#pallets) and reuse existing pallets,
including [over 50 of those shipped with Substrate](/v3/runtime/frame#prebuilt-pallets).

![Runtime Composition](../../../../src/images/docs/concepts/frame-runtime.png)

There are an additional set of primitives that are assumed about a runtime built with the Substrate
FRAME. These are:

- `Call`: The dispatch type that can be called via an extrinsic.

- `Origin`: Represents where a call came from. For example, a signed message (a transaction), an
  unsigned message (an inherent extrinsic), or a call from the runtime itself (a root call).

- `Index`: An account index (aka nonce) type. This stores the number of previous transactions
  associated with a sender account.

- `Hashing`: The hashing algorithm being used in the runtime (e.g. Blake2).

- `AccountId`: The type used to identify user accounts in the runtime.

- `Event`: The type used for events emitted by the runtime.

- `Version`: A type which represents the version of the runtime.

Although a lot of core runtime development can be enabled with FRAME and
its related primitives, FRAME is not the only system for developing
Substrate based blockchains.
