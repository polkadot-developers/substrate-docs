The **Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (FRAME)** is a set of modules and support libraries that
simplify runtime development. In Substrate, these modules are called Pallets, each hosting domain-specific logic to include
in a chain's runtime.

FRAME also provides some helper modules to interact with important [Substrate Primitives](/rustdocs/latest/sc_service/index.html) that provide the
interface to the core client.

The following diagram shows the architectural overview of FRAME and its support libraries:

![FRAME Architecture](../../../../src/images/docs/runtime/frame-arch.png)

## Pallets

When building with FRAME, the Substrate runtime is composed of several smaller components called
pallets. A pallet contains a set of types, storage items, and functions that define a set of
features and functionality for a runtime.

  our introductory tutorial for
  [creating your first Substrate chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain).`}
/>

FRAME not only provides a library of commonly used Substrate pallets but also a framework to build custom domain-specific
pallets, giving runtime engineers the flexibility to define their runtime's behaviour according to their
target use case. The result is each pallet has its own discrete logic which can modify the features and
functionality of your blockchain's state transition functions.

For example, the [Balances pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/balances),
which is included in [FRAME](/v3/getting-started/glossary#frame), defines cryptocurrency
capabilities for your blockchain. More specifically, it defines:

- **Storage items** that keep track of the tokens a user owns.
- **Functions** that users can call to transfer and manage those tokens.
- **APIs** which allow other pallets to make use of those tokens and their capabilities.
- **Hooks** which allow other pallets to trigger function calls when a user's balance changes.

Substrate runtime engineers can define custom logics for their blockchain by writing their own
pallets and encapsulating their blockchains desired functionality by combining custom pallets with
existing FRAME pallets or Substrate modules alike. The following documentation will show you how.

### Skeleton of a pallet

A FRAME pallet is composed of 7 sections:

1. Imports and Dependencies
2. Declaration of the Pallet type
3. Runtime Configuration Trait
4. Runtime Storage
5. Runtime Events
6. Hooks
7. Extrinsics

An example is as follows:

```rust
// 1. Imports and Dependencies
pub use pallet::*;
#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
	use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
	use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

	// 2. Declaration of the Pallet type
	// This is a placeholder to implement traits and methods.
	#[pallet::pallet]
	#[pallet::generate_store(pub(super) trait Store)]
	pub struct Pallet<T>(PhantomData<T>);

	// 3. Runtime Configuration Trait
	// All types and constants go here.
	// Use #[pallet::constant] and #[pallet::extra_constants]
	// to pass in values to metadata.
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config { ... }

	// 4. Runtime Storage
	// Use to declare storage items.
	#[pallet::storage]
	#[pallet::getter(fn something)]
	pub MyStorage<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u32>;

	// 5. Runtime Events
	// Can stringify event types to metadata.
	#[pallet::event]
	#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
	pub enum Event<T: Config> { ... }

	// 6. Hooks
	// Define some logic that should be executed
	// regularly in some context, for e.g. on_initialize.
	#[pallet::hooks]
	impl<T: Config> Hooks<BlockNumberFor<T>> for Pallet<T> { ... }

	// 7. Extrinsics
	// Functions that are callable from outside the runtime.
	#[pallet::call]
	impl<T:Config> Pallet<T> { ... }

}
```

  text={`Pallets can be composed of as many sections as needed, giving runtime engineers a lot of 
  flexibility on top of the basic skeletons depicted above. Refer to the [Substrate Runtime Macros](../macros#substrate-runtime-macros)

/>

### System crate

The [FRAME System crate `frame_system`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_system/index.html) provides low-level types,
storage, and functions for your blockchain. All other pallets depend on the System crate as the
basis of your Substrate runtime.

The System crate defines all the core types for the Substrate runtime, such as:

- Origin
- Block Number
- Account Id
- Hash
- Header
- Version
- etc...

It also has a number of system-critical storage items, such as:

- Account Nonce
- Block Hash
- Block Number
- Events
- etc...

Finally, it defines a number of low level functions which can access your blockchain storage, verify
the origin of an extrinsic, and more.

### Support crate 

The [FRAME Support Crate `frame_support`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/index.html) is a collection of Rust
macros, types, traits, and modules that simplify the development of Substrate pallets.

The support macros expanded at compile time generate boilerplate code needed for the common
structure of a pallet and save developers from writing them repeatedly.

### Executive pallet

The [FRAME Executive Pallet `frame_executive`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_executive/index.html) acts as the
orchestration layer for the runtime. It dispatches incoming extrinsic calls to the respective
pallets in the runtime.

### Runtime

The runtime library brings together all these components and pallets. It defines which pallets are
included with your runtime and configures them to work together to compose your final runtime. When
calls are made to your runtime, it uses the Executive pallet to dispatch those calls to the
individual pallets.

## Prebuilt pallets

Some pallets will be sufficiently general-purpose to be reused in many blockchains. Anyone is free
to write and share useful pallets. There is a collection of popular pallets provided with Substrate.
Let's explore them.

### Assets

make calls on-behalf-of another account which they have recovered. The recovery process is protected
by trusted "friends" whom the original account owner chooses. A threshold (M) out of N friends are
needed to give another account access to the recoverable account.
