Remote Procedure Calls, or RPCs, are a way for an external program 
(eg. a frontend) to communicate with a Substrate node. They are used 
for checking storage values, submitting transactions, and querying the 
current consensus authorities. Substrate comes with several [default RPCs](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc/). 
In many cases it is useful to add custom RPCs to your node. 

## The RPC extensions builder

In order to connect custom RPCs you must provide a function known as an "RPC extension builder". 
This function takes a parameter for whether the node should deny unsafe RPC calls, and returns 
an [`IoHandler`](/rustdocs/latest/node_rpc/type.IoHandler.html) that the node needs to create a
JSON RPC. For more context, read more by looking at the
[`RpcExtensionBuilder` trait API](/rustdocs/latest/sc_service/trait.RpcExtensionBuilder.html)
documentation.

## RPC types 

RPCs can be interfaces to a node's consensus mechanisms, or interfaces with any outside user to
submit transactions to the blockchain. In all cases, it's important to consider what endpoints
RPCs expose.

Launch a node and run this command to see a full list of your node's RPC APIs:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "rpc_methods"}' http://localhost:9933/
```

### Public RPCs

Substrate nodes contain a set of CLI flags that allow you to expose the RPC interfaces publicly, namely:

```bash
--ws-external
--rpc-external
```

Each have additional `--unsafe-*` versions. By default the node will refuse to start if you try to expose 
an RPC interface and run a validator node at the same time. `--unsafe-*` flags allow to suppress this security measure.
Exposing RPC interfaces may open up a huge surface of attacks and has to be carefully reviewed. 

There are quite a few RPC methods that can be used to control the node's behaviour and should never (or rarely) be exposed:

- [`author_submitExtrinsic`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.submit_extrinsic) - allows submitting transactions to local pool.
- [`author_insertKey`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.insert_key) - allows inserting private keys to local keystore.
- [`author_rotateKeys`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.rotate_keys) - session keys rotation.
- [`author_removeExtrinsic`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.remove_extrinsic) - remove and ban extrinsic from the pool.
- [`system_addReservedPeer`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/system/trait.SystemApi.html#tymethod.system_add_reserved_peer) - add reserved node.
- [`system_removeReservedPeer`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/system/trait.SystemApi.html#tymethod.system_remove_reserved_peer) - removed reserved node.

Other RPCs are not so much dangerous but can take a long time to execute, potentially blocking the client from syncing. These include:

- [`storage_keys_paged`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/state/trait.StateApi.html#tymethod.storage_keys_paged) - get all the keys in the state with a particular prefix and pagination support.
- [`state_getPairs`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc_api/state/trait.StateApi.html#tymethod.storage_pairs) - get all the keys in the state with a particular prefix together with their values.

<Message type={`gray`} title={`Note`} text={`
These RPCs are declared by using the \`#[rpc(name = "rpc_method")]\` macro, where "\`rpc_method\`" would be the name of the function &mdash; \`author_submitExtrinsic\` for example, 
corresponding to [\`submit_extrinsic\`](/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.submit_extrinsic).`}
/> 

It's critical to filter out these kind of calls if the requests are coming from untrusted users.
The way to do it is through a [JSON-RPC](/v3/getting-started/glossary#json-rpc) proxy that is
able to inspect calls and only pass allowed-set of APIs.

## RPCs for `remote_externalities`

There exists a special type of using RPCs in the context of `remote_externalities`.
[This `rpc_api`](/rustdocs/latest/remote_externalities/rpc_api/index.html) allows you to make
one-off RPC calls to a Substrate node, useful for testing purposes with tools like
[`try-runtime`](/v3/tools/try-runtime) for example.

## Endpoints

When starting any Substrate node, these two endpoints are made available to you:

- HTTP Endpoint: http://localhost:9933/
- Websocket Endpoint: ws://localhost:9944/

Most of the Substrate front-end libraries and tools use the more powerful WebSocket endpoint to
interact with the blockchain. Through WebSockets, you can subscribe to the chain states, such as
events, and receive push notifications whenever changes in your blockchain occur.

To call the `Metadata` endpoint, run this command alongside a running node:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata"}' http://localhost:9933/
```

The return value of this command is not in human readable format. For that, it needs to use the
[SCALE codec](/v3/advanced/scale-codec) encoding scheme.

Each storage item has a relative storage key associated to it which is used to
[query storage](/v3/advanced/storage#querying-storage). This is how RPC endpoints know where to look.

## Examples

### `state_getMetadata`

RPC request:

```javascript
function get_metadata_request(endpoint) {
  let request = new Request(endpoint, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
      method: "state_getMetadata"
    }),
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
  });
  return request;
}
```

Naive text decoding:

```javascript
function decode_metadata(metadata) {
  return new TextDecoder().decode(util.hexToU8a(metadata));
}
```

### `state_getStorage`

RPC request:
```json
Request:   {"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"state_getStorage",["{storage_key}"]}
```
Where `storage_key` is a parameter generated by the name of a pallet, function and key (optionally):

```javascript
function get_runtime_storage_parameter_with_key(
  module_name,
  function_name,
  key
) {
  // We use xxhash 128 for strings the runtime developer can control
  let module_hash = util_crypto.xxhashAsU8a(module_name, 128);
  let function_hash = util_crypto.xxhashAsU8a(function_name, 128);

  // We use blake2 256 for strings the end user can control
  let key_hash = util_crypto.blake2AsU8a(keyToBytes(key));

  // Special syntax to concatenate Uint8Array
  let final_key = new Uint8Array([
    ...module_hash,
    ...function_hash,
    ...key_hash,
  ]);

  // Return a hex string
  return util.u8aToHex(final_key);
}
```
