  - **Safety.** The mint function takes in an amount to 'mint' which is *not good practice* because it implies that
    users have unlimited access to writing to storage. Safer approaches include: using configuring 'GenesisConfig' or
    fixing a predetermined maximum value in runtime.
  - **Weights.** All the weights were set to 10_000 in the above code snippets. Learn more about weight
    configuration in this [basic guide on weights](./basic-tx-weight-calculations).
  - **Origins.** One assumption this guide makes is that the origin will always be the sudo user.
    Origins are a powerful capability in Substrate. Learn more about how they work
    [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/origin).
