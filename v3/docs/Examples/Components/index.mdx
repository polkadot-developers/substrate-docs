  - **Safety.** The mint function takes in an amount to 'mint' which is *not good practice* because it implies that
    users have unlimited access to writing to storage. Safer approaches include: using configuring 'GenesisConfig' or
    fixing a predetermined maximum value in runtime.
  - **Weights.** All the weights were set to 10_000 in the above code snippets. Learn more about weight
    configuration in this [basic guide on weights](./basic-tx-weight-calculations).
  - **Origins.** One assumption this guide makes is that the origin will always be the sudo user.
    Origins are a powerful capability in Substrate. Learn more about how they work
    [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/origin).

### Tutorial Breakdown

#### What You Will Be Doing

Before we even get started, lets' layout what we are going to do over the course of this turorial. We will:

<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '1. Set up your computer to be able to develop with Substrate.',
    textLineTwo: 'Smart contract chain with focus on community governance',
    url: '#',
  }}
/>
<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '2. Use a node template project to run a Substrate-based blockchain.',
    textLineTwo: 'Smart contract chain with focus on community governance',
    url: '#',
  }}
/>
<TutorialObjective
  data={{
    textLineOne:
      '3. Use a front-end template project to interact with the template node.',
    textLineTwo: 'Smart contract chain with focus on community governance',
