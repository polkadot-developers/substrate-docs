This guide focuses on best practices for writing technical documentation and on the style conventions to use when 
developing documentation for Parity Technologies products and audiences. 
The goal of this guide is to help members of the documentation team and any one interested in contributing to documentation 
write material that is clear, concise, and consistent.

If you can't find the answer to a style, voice, or terminology question in this guide, consult the following resources:

* [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
* [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)

## General guidance for writing engaging content

There are three keys to writing content that engages the audience:

* Use the _second person_ point of view to directly address the reader.
* Use an _active voice_ and _present tense_ whenever possible.
* Use a _conversational tone_ that is not too formal or too chummy.

### Point of view

In most cases, address the reader directly. For tutorials, use either first person plural—we, us, our, ours—or second person point of view. 
Because tutorials provide a more guided approach to a topic, using the first person plural is a more natural 
and commonly-accepted practice than in other types of documentation.

Use the first person point of view sparingly and with intention. When overused, the first person narrative can
 overwhelm the sense of a shared experience and obscure the reader’s journey.

Do not use “I” or “me” unless it appears in the text of a user interface element. 

Do not use “we” to refer to Parity or the Substrate Developer Hub team. For example, if you are documenting a
recommended setting or practice, use “Parity Technologies recommends....” not “We recommend...”.

### Passive constructions

In spite of the axiom to never use the passive voice, there are situations where a passive sentence structure might be appropriate. 
Don’t twist a sentence into knots just to avoid a passive construction. Passive voice does have its place, but be wary of using it. 

When writing about software, it’s often tempting to describe what’s happening from the code point of view. 
However, there’s almost always a human being with a goal or task to complete who is initiating the activity that the software is executing. 
If you keep this human presence in mind, your writing will be more dynamic, easier to follow, and more interesting to read.

### Contractions and conversational tone

Contractions are generally acceptable because they give documentation a more natural conversational tone—at least for English speakers. 
Be conscious of when and why you use contractions.

To keep the tone conversational but concise, adhere to the following common-sense guidelines:

* Use common, well-known words whenever possible. 

* Don’t use flowery language or literary flourish words and phrases like “and so forth”, “albeit”, “heretofore”, or “thus”.

* Try to be precise in word choice. For example:

  * Don’t use “when”—implying eventuality and time—as interchangeable with “if”, which implies the possibility of something happening.

  * Don’t use phrases that introduce ambiguity. For example, instead of “When the process completes...” use “After the process completes...”.
  
  * Think carefully about word choices like using “since” (implying a period of time) instead of “because” (implying cause and result) or using “once” (single occurrence) instead of “after” (each time).

* Avoid using dead language words and phrases even if they are generally accepted as English words in practice. For example:

  * Instead of “i.e.”, use “that is” or rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear without needing extra qualification.
  
  * Instead of “e.g.”, use “for example”.
  
  * Instead of “via”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “by”, “through”, or “using”.
  
  * Instead of “etc.”, use “and so on” or revise the content to make the term unnecessary. For example, revise to use such as or like followed by an example or two.
  
  * Instead of “caveat”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “notice”, “caution”, or “warning”.

* Avoid adding unnecessary words or phrases. For example:
  
  * Instead of “In order to”, just use “to”.
  
  * Instead of “as well as”, just use “and”.
  
  * Instead of “and then”, just use “then”.

* Avoid jargon, colloquialisms, and idiomatic phrases.

## Headings

All heading levels should use the following conventions:

* Use sentence style case.

* Use active, present tense verbs in headings wherever appropriate, especially in the context of tutorials and how-to guides.

* Serve as a summary of the content they contain. 

* Avoid generic headings like overview and introduction, if possible. While generic heading can be conceptually useful, they add no value to the content or the navigational experience. 

* Always contain content. 
  A heading should never be immediately followed by another heading. 
  As a best practice, avoid using headings strictly for navigation.

### Limit heading levels
  
As a best practice, avoid building an information hierarchy with more than three heading levels. 
Most content can be effectively organized using two internal heading levels, making it easier to navigate and scan for relevant topics.

### Topic titles

Avoid using gerunds (verbs that end with -ing) in titles and headings.
Procedure titles and headings should answer the question: _What are you trying to do?_ For example, if the answer to _What are you trying to do?_ 
is _I want to create an account_, the article heading should be _Create an account_.
In most cases, concept and reference topics are named with a noun phrase, such as _Event hooks_.

## Bullets

Bullets are for unordered lists. 
The order of items in a bulleted list can imply importance, but generally all list items are peers.

Each list item should start with a capital letter and end with a period unless all of the list items are 
single words or short phrases of no more than four words. 
Use parallel structure in phrasing the items in a list. 
For example, each list item might start with a verb, noun, or gerund. 
  
## Numbered steps

Only use numbered paragraphs for steps in procedures.
If a procedure has more than nine steps, always consider breaking it into subsections with headings. Ideally, each procedure or subtask should be three to six steps, not have nested sub-steps, and have minimal embedded paragraphs describing what happens—the result or outcome to expect—in an unnumbered paragraph following the step. 

## Pronouns

Use gender-neutral pronouns, like “they” whenever possible. 
Generally, you can change any noun from singular to plural to have subject-verb-pronoun agreement and avoid the use of gender-specific pronouns like “he”, “him”, “his” or “she”, “her”, “hers”.

## Terminology and usage conventions

This section covers common terminology, style, and usage questions and recommended practices.

### Above and below

Don't use _above_ to mean _earlier_ or as an adjective preceding a noun (_the above section_) or following a noun (_the code above_). Use a hyperlink, or use _previous_, _preceding_, or _earlier_.

Don't use _below_ to mean _later_ or as an adjective preceding a noun (_the below section_) or following a noun (_the code below_). 
Use a hyperlink, or use _later_ or _the following_.

For example:
Use the preceding code to display information about the database.
Use the following code to display information about the database.

### Dates and numbers

Use the DD Mon YYYY or DD Month YYYY format for dates.

In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine.
Use numerals for 10 or greater. 
Use commas in numbers with four or more digits. 
Use _more than_ instead of _over_ (over is a spatial term).

### Emphasis and admonitionments

Use bold formatting for user interface elements that the user interacts with, including:
* Dialog titles
* Field labels
* Buttons labels
* Options displayed in the user interface

Don't use bold, italics, or underlining for emphasis. If there's text that requires more attention than the surrounding body, 
consider isolating it as a standalone note or tip.

NOTE: Indicates neutral or positive information that emphasizes or supplements important points of the main text. 
A note supplies information that may apply only in special cases. Examples are memory limitations, equipment 
configurations, or details that apply to specific versions of a program.

TIP: Helps users apply the techniques and procedures described in the text to their specific needs. 
A tip suggests alternative methods that may not be obvious and helps users understand the benefits and capabilities of the product. 
A tip is not essential to the basic understanding of the text.

CAUTION: Advises users that failure to take or avoid a specific action could result in loss of data. 

### Images

Diagrams and illustrations can help readers visualize and internalize complex ideas and processes.
So, use them liberally but with intention.
Images also help to break up long text flows, but they should always reinforce and reflect the text immediately preceding or immediately following the image.

If you include screenshots, only include the relevant parts of the screen and use callouts to highlight how what is captured in the image is relevant to the text.

Be wary of using diagrams or illustrations that include any information—visual or textual—that is likely to get stale.

### Punctuation

| Element | How to use it
| ------- | -------------
| capitalization | Use sentence style capitalization for all headings. When referring to elements in the user interface, follow the capitalization that is used in the labels or text. Do not capitalize common terms.
| colon (:) | Use a colon at the end of the statement that introduces a procedure, bulleted list, or table.
| comma (,) | Use a serial comma to separate three or more items in a series, including the item before the conjunction.
| em dash (—) | Use an em dash (—) to set off a parenthetical phrase with more emphasis than parentheses provide. Don’t add spaces around an em dash. Don’t capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.
| hyphenation (-) | Avoid using hyphenated compound words. Use hyphens only if the meaning is unclear without them or if the only recognized form of the word includes a hyphen.
| quotation marks (" ") | Avoid using quotation marks unless you need to quote a message or as tring that would otherwise be confusing given its surrounding context.
| semicolons (;) | Don't use semicolons instead of commas to separate items in a list. If you think the content should use semicolons, consider rewriting it into subtopics or an unordered bullet list.
| Slashes (/) and backslashes (\) | Avoid using slashes or backslashes except when documenting paths that require either forward or backward slashes. Never use _and/or_ in documentation.

### User interface elements

In general,  you should avoid writing about user interface elements. Instead, documentation should always focus on what the audience 
needs to do or wants to accomplish and not what is displayed on the screen.

| Element | What to do
| ------- | -----------
| button | Use bold for the button label. Don't include "button" in the description. For example: Click **Submit**.
| checkbox | Use checkbox, not box or check box, if you need to refer to a checkbox in the user interface. Use _select_ and _clear_ with checkboxes, not turn on and turn off, mark and unmark, check and uncheck, or unselect and deselect.
| click | Use click to describe taking action on a standalone button. Do not use click on. Click and select are not interchangeable.
| dialog | If you need to refer to a dialog box, use dialog. Don't use pop-up window, dialog box, or dialogue box.
| dropdown | Use _dropdown_ as an adjective, not as a noun. For example, use _dropdown list_.

### Verb usage

| Verb | How to use it
| ---- | -------------
| allow, enable | Avoid using software as a point of view and consider rewriting to focus on the human interacting with the software.
| can, may, might | Use the verb _can_ when describing ability, capability, or capacity. Avoid using the verb _may_ because it implies permission. Use the past tense _might_ when describing the possibility or eventuality of an outcome.
| clear | Use __clear_ rather than _deselect_ or _unselect_ if you have to describe removing a selection from a checkbox.
| displays | Use the transitive verb displays rather than the intransitive verb appears. Use displays with a direct object. For example, The command displays log messages.
| ensure | Use _ensure_ to mean to make sure or to guarantee. Remember that this is not interchangeable with assure (to make confident) and insure (to provide insurance).
| enter, type | Use _enter_ to instruct the user to input a value by pressing the Enter or Return key. Use _type_ to instruct the user to type a value in a field.
| select | Use select to describe taking action on a menu item, checkbox, or radio button. Note that click and select are not interchangeable.
| set up, setup | Use _set up_—two words, no hyphen—when used as a verb. Don't hyphenate. Use _setup_—one word, no hyphen—when used as an adjective or as a noun.
| want, wish | Use _want_ instead of wish or desire when the user has a choice of actions.

### Word choice

| Word in question | How to use it
| ---- | -------------
| affect, effect | Use _affect_ as a verb and use _effect_ as a noun.
| app, application | Use _application_ or _applications_ unless there’s a specific reason for using the shorthand term _app_ or _apps_.
| back-end, front-end | Using the hyphen in these terms  is still more common than not using it. Both forms are acceptable, but for consistency use the hyphen.
| email | It hasn’t been e-mail for thirty-plus years. Never use emails. Don’t use email as a verb.
| file name | Use _file name_ as two words, not _filename_.
| its, it’s | Use _its_ as a possessive meaning belonging to or associated with an object or idea previously mentioned. Because it is a vague pronoun, be sure what _it_ refers to can be easily identified. Use _it’s_ only as a contraction for _it is_ or _it has_.
| please | Avoid using _please_ in documentation unless there’s a specific reason for using it. For example, you might use please if quoting the content of a message that asks the user to do something inconvenient.
| prerequisite | As a section title, use _Before you begin_ instead. If you use _prerequisite_ in the text, there’s no hyphen.
| that, which | Use _that_ at the beginning of a clause that’s necessary for the sentence to make sense. Don’t put a comma before it. Don't use that when introducing a clause referring to people. Use _who_. Use _which_ at the beginning of a clause that adds supporting or parenthetical information to a sentence. If you can omit the clause and the sentence still makes sense, use _which_, and put a comma before it.
| user name | Use user name as two words, not username.
