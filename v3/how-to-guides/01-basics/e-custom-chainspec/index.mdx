## Steps

### 1. Create a plain chain specification

Starting in the working directory of your node's working directory, and assuming the bin is `node-template`:

```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec > chain-spec-plain.json
```

We have just generated a **plain chain spec** file for the _default_ network set in your
`chain_spec.rs` file. This file can be passed to other nodes

### 2. Modify the plain chain specification (optional)

This optional step we can leverage an _existing_ plain chain specification for a network that otherwise would require modifiaciton of te _source_ of the node to run on a _new network_.
For example, this can be quite usefull in the [Cumulus Tutorial](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay) where we want to create a custom _relay chain_ without customizing Polkadot's source.

Here we use the _same_ chainspec, but pass a flag to disable bootnodes, as we want a _new_ network where hese nodes will be different.

```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec --chain chain-spec-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > no-bootnodes-chain-spec-plain.json
```

This `no-bootnodes-chain-spec-plain.json` can be used to generate a compacified, distributable raw chainspec.

### 3. Generate the raw chain specification

With a plain spec avalible, you generate a final raw chain spec by:

```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec --chain chain-spec-plain.json --raw > chain-spec.json
```

### 4. Publsh the chain specification

    different Wasm blob which will break consensus if each participant generates the file themselves.

It is _conventional_ to include the chain specification files for your node _within the source code itself_ so that anyone building your node and avoid any chance of non-determinism causing nodes to belive they are on different networks (as the genesis blob may differ).
Polkadot, Kusama, Rococo, and more network chainpec files are found [in the source here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res) along with a `.gitignore` file to ensure that you don't acidentally change these `!/*.json` files as you build futher on your node's software and do [runtime upgrades](/tutorials/v3/forkless-upgrades).

### 5. Start a new node

If you publish a node binary, or have users build thier own and then they want to join your network, all then need is the _same_ chain spec file and to run your binary with:

```bash
# binary named `node-template`
# `chain-spec.json` obtained from cononical common source
node-template --chain chain-spec.json
```

This can also simply be configured to be the _default_ network.
For reference, you can see how [Polkadot impliments](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commits/master/cli/src/command.rs) a default command that uses the chain specs for various networks [in the source here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
