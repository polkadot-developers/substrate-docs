This guide is an extension to the ["Add a Pallet to Your Runtime" tutorial](/tutorials/v3/add-a-pallet) and explains how to quickly integrate both local and external pallets in a runtime.

You will learn how to include a custom internal pallet that implements an event and a call for runtime, and how to include an external pallet from `Crates.io` to a runtime.

## Import a pallet

1. Create a local pallet called `pallet_something`.

  Import this pallet by adding the following to `/runtime/src/lib.rs`:

  ```rust
  // Import your pallet.
  pub use pallet_something;
  ```

1. Configure your pallet's runtime implementation. 
  Assume the local pallet only has the `Event` and `Call` types exposed to the runtime. Add the following to `/runtime/src/lib.rs`:

  ```rust
  // Configure your pallet.
  impl pallet_something::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type Call = Call;
  }
  ```

1. Declare your pallet and the items it exposes. 
  Include the additional `Pallet` and `Storage` types for the [runtime macro](/v3/runtime/macros/#construct_runtime). In `construct_runtime!`, add the following:

  ```rust
  construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
      Block = Block,
      NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
      UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
    {
  /* --snip-- */
      Something: pallet_something::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
  /* --snip-- */
    }
  );
  ```

> **NOTE:** To add an external pallet, you use a similar method to the one you used with the local pallet, but you must include all of the types your pallet exposes.
You must also include the relevant parameter types and constants. For examples of how to declare parameters and constants, see [`pallet_timestamp`][timestamp-frame].

1. Update `/runtime/Cargo.toml`

  **Local pallets**

  In `/runtime/Cargo.toml`, include your pallet as a local dependency in `std` and add `runtime-benchmarks`. For example:

  ```rust
  /* --snip-- */
  [dependencies.pallet-something]
  default-features = false
  path = '../pallets/something'
  version = '3.0.0'
  /* --snip-- */
  [features]
  default = ['std']
  runtime-benchmarks = [
    /* --snip */
    'pallet-something/runtime-benchmarks',
  ]
  std = [
    'pallet-something/std',
  /* --snip-- */
  ]
  ```

  **External pallets**

  The following is an example of how you would add an external pallet if the pallet is hosted in [crates.parity.io](https://crates.parity.io/):

  ```rust
  [dependencies.pallet-external]
  default-features = false
  git = 'https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git'
  rev = 'd6c33e7ec313f9bd5e319dc0a5a3ace5543f9617'
  version = '3.0.0'
  /* --snip-- */
  runtime-benchmarks = [
    /* --snip */
    'pallet-external/runtime-benchmarks',
  ]
  std = [
  'pallet-external/std',
  /* --snip-- */
  ]
  ```
