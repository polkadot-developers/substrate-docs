## Steps

### 1. Import your pallet

#### For local pallets

Assuming a pallet called `pallet_something` is created, the first step is to import it in `/runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
// Import your pallet.
pub use pallet_something;
```

### 2. Include it in `/runtime/src/lib.rs`

#### For local pallets

Configure your pallet's runtime implementation. Assuming the local pallet only has `Event` and `Call` types exposed to the runtime:

```rust
// Configure your pallet.
impl pallet_something::Config for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type Call = Call;
}
```

Then, declare your pallet and the items it exposes in `construct_runtime!`, including the additional `Module` and `Storage`
types for the runtime macro:

```rust
construct_runtime!(
	pub enum Runtime where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
	{
/* --snip-- */
		Something: pallet_something::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
/* --snip-- */
	}
);
```

#### For external pallets

The same pattern applies as for declaring a local pallet, except you must ensure you include all the types your pallet exposes.
In addition, don't forget to include relevant parameter types and constants if relevant. See this examples on how [`pallet_timestamp`][timestamp-frame]
is declared.

### 3. Update `/runtime/Cargo.toml`

#### For local pallets

In `/runtime/Cargo.toml`, include your pallet as a local dependency, include it in `std` and add `runtime-benchmarks`:

```rust
/* --snip-- */
[dependencies.pallet-something]
default-features = false
path = '../pallets/something'
version = '3.0.0'
/* --snip-- */
[features]
default = ['std']
runtime-benchmarks = [
	/* --snip */
	'pallet-something/runtime-benchmarks',
]
std = [
	'pallet-something/std',
/* --snip-- */
]
```

#### For external pallets

Assuming the pallet is hosted in <ExternalLink url={'https://crates.parity.io/'}>crates.parity.io</ExternalLink>, adding it to the runtime would look like this:

```rust
[dependencies.pallet-external]
default-features = false
git = 'https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git'
rev = 'd6c33e7ec313f9bd5e319dc0a5a3ace5543f9617'
version = '3.0.0'
/* --snip-- */
runtime-benchmarks = [
	/* --snip */
	'pallet-external/runtime-benchmarks',
]
std = [
'pallet-external/std',
/* --snip-- */
]
```
