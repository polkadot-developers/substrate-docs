This guide is an extension to the ["Add a Pallet to Your Runtime" tutorial](/tutorials/v3/add-a-pallet) and explains how to quickly integrate both local and external pallets in a runtime.

You will learn how to include a custom internal pallet that implements an event and a call for runtime, and how to include an external pallet from `Crates.io` to a runtime.

## Import a pallet

1. Create a local pallet called `pallet_something`.

   Import this pallet by adding the following to `/runtime/src/lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   // Import your pallet.
   pub use pallet_something;
   ```

1. Configure your pallet's runtime implementation.
   Assume the local pallet only has the `Event` and `Call` types exposed to the runtime. Add the following to `/runtime/src/lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   // Configure your pallet.
   impl pallet_something::Config for Runtime {
   	type Event = Event;
   	type Call = Call;
   }
   ```

1. Declare your pallet and the items it exposes.
   Include the additional `Pallet` and `Storage` types for the [runtime macro](/v3/runtime/macros/#construct_runtime). In `construct_runtime!`, add the following:

   ```rust
   construct_runtime!(
   	pub enum Runtime where
   	Block = Block,
   	NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
   	UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
   	{
   		/* --snip-- */
   		Something: pallet_something::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
   		/* --snip-- */
   	}
   );
   ```

> **NOTE:** To add an external pallet, you use a similar method to the one you used with the local pallet, but you must include all of the types your pallet exposes.
> You must also include the relevant parameter types and constants. For examples of how to declare parameters and constants, see [`pallet_timestamp`][timestamp-frame].

1. Update `/runtime/Cargo.toml`

   **Local pallets**

   In `/runtime/Cargo.toml`, include your pallet as a local dependency in `std` and add `runtime-benchmarks`. For example:

   ```TOML
   # --snip--
   [dependencies.pallet-something]
   default-features = false
   path = '../pallets/something'
   version = '3.0.0'
   # --snip--
   [features]
   default = ['std']
   runtime-benchmarks = [
     # --snip--
     'pallet-something/runtime-benchmarks',
   ]
   std = [
     'pallet-something/std',
     # --snip--
   ]
   ```

**External pallets**

The following is an example of how you would add an external pallet if the pallet is hosted in [crates.parity.io](https://crates.parity.io/):

```TOML
[dependencies.pallet-external]
default-features = false
git = 'https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git'
rev = 'd6c33e7ec313f9bd5e319dc0a5a3ace5543f9617'
version = '3.0.0'
# --snip--
runtime-benchmarks = [
  /* --snip */
  'pallet-external/runtime-benchmarks',
]
std = [
  'pallet-external/std',
  # --snip--
]
```
