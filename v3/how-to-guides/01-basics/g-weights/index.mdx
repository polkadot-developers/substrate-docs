        Weights are an important part of Substrate development because they provide information about the maximum cost of a function in terms of the block size it will take up.
        This way, the [weighting system](/v3/concepts/weight) checks what the cost will be before a function is executed.
        As runtime engineers, we care a lot about weights.
        Not only do they help add security checks around the functions we create, but they also force us to think about the computational ressources consumed by a transaction.
        From that, we can figure out [what fees to charge](/v3/runtime/weights-and-fees) users.
        This guide will cover how to calculate the maximum weight for a dispatch call; calculate the actual weight after execution; and reimburse the difference.
        Here's an overview of the traits we'll be implementing:
        - [\`PaysFee\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/weights/trait.PaysFee.html): to specify whether or not a dispatch pays the fee.
        - [\`GetDispatchInfo\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/weights/trait.GetDispatchInfo.html): carries weight information using the \`#[weight]\` attribute.
        - [\`DispatchResultWithPostInfo\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/dispatch/type.DispatchResultWithPostInfo.html): provides new weight info once the extrinsic function has been executed.

    },

## Steps

### 1. Import weight configuration tools

Make sure you have the right dependencies:

```rust
use frame_support::Parameter;
use frame_support::weights::{GetDispatchInfo, Pays};
use sp_runtime::traits::Dispatchable;
use frame_support::pallet_prelude::{DispatchResultWithPostInfo};
use frame_support::dispatch::DispatchResult;
```

### 2. Calculate maximum weight before a function

Using `call.get_dispatch_info()`, calculate the maximum possible weight before the function is declared:

```rust
#[weight = {
  let dispatch_info = call.get_dispatch_info();
  (dispatch_info.weight, dispatch_info.class, Pays::Yes)
  }]
    // Define a function header that returns DispatchResultWithPostInfo.
    fn do_three_reads(origin, call: Box<<T as Config>::Call>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    // Function logic.
    }
```

`GetDispatchInfo` provides the `get_dispatch_info()` method we need to retrieve information about the function's weight.

### 3. Calculate the actual weight linked to function's logic

The actual weight of a function call depends on the logic of the extrinsic.
After execution, we can give back fees once the actual weight has been calculated.
Handle this using the [`Pays` Enum][pays-rustdocs] and [`DbWeight`][dbweight-rustdocs].

For a function whose logic does three storage reads, calculate it using `DbWeight` and return it at the end of the function:

```rust
// Function returns a calculation corresponding to 3 DB reads
let check_logic_weight = T::DbWeight::get().reads(3);
return Ok(Some(check_logic_weight).into())

//Remove fee assoicated to weight
Ok(Pays::Yes.into())
```
