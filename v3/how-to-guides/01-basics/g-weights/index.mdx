    "This guide shows a basic procedure for confirguring weights. There are more
    advanced methods that suit different use cases. For simple functions with fixed amounts
    of storage reads, this method works well. For any other use cases, see the section

        `Weights are an important part of Substrate development as they provide information about what the maximum cost a function can 
        be in terms of the block size it will take up. This way, the [weighting system](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/learn-substrate/weight) 
        checks what the cost will be before 
        a function is executed. As runtime engineers, we care a lot about weights. Not only do they help add security checks around the 
        functions we create, but they also force us to think about the computational ressources consumed by a transaction. From that, we 
        can figure out [what fees to charge](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/fees) users.
        This guide will cover how to calculate the maximum weight for a dispatch call; calculate the actual weight after execution; and
        reimburse the difference.
        Here's an overview of the traits we'll be implementing:
        - [\`PaysFee\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/weights/trait.PaysFee.html): to specify whether or not a dispatch pays the fee.
        - [\`GetDispatchInfo\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/weights/trait.GetDispatchInfo.html): carries weight information using the \`#[weight]\` attribute.
        - [\`DispatchResultWithPostInfo\`](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/dispatch/type.DispatchResultWithPostInfo.html): provides new weight info once the extrinsic function has been executed.
	    `,
    },

## Steps

### 1. Import weight configuration tools

Make sure you have the right dependencies:

```rust
use frame_support::Parameter;
use frame_support::weights::{GetDispatchInfo, Pays};
use sp_runtime::traits::Dispatchable;
use frame_support::pallet_prelude::{DispatchResultWithPostInfo};
use frame_support::dispatch::DispatchResult;
```

### 2. Calculate maximum weight before a function

Using `call.get_dispatch_info()`, calculate the maximum possible weight before the function is declared:

```rust
#[weight = {
			let dispatch_info = call.get_dispatch_info();
			(dispatch_info.weight, dispatch_info.class, Pays::Yes)
            }]

      // Define a function header that returns DispatchResultWithPostInfo.
		  fn do_three_reads(origin, call: Box<<T as Config>::Call>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
      // Function logic.
        }
```

`GetDispatchInfo` provides the `get_dispatch_info()` method we need to retrieve information about the function's weight.

### 3. Calculate the actual weight linked to function's logic

The actual weight of a function call depends on the logic of the extrinsic. After execution, we can give back fees once the actual weight has been calculated. Handle this using the [`Pays` Enum][pays-rustdocs] and [`DbWeight`][dbweight-rustdocs].

For a function whose logic does 3 storage reads, calculate it using `DbWeight` and return it at the end of the function:

```rust
// Function returns a calculation corresponding to 3 DB reads
let check_logic_weight = T::DbWeight::get().reads(3);
return Ok(Some(check_logic_weight).into())

//Remove fee assoicated to weight
Ok(Pays::Yes.into())
```
