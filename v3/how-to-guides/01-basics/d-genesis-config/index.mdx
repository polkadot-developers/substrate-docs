## Goal

Learn how to customize a chain's genesis configuration for the [balances pallet][balances-frame].

## Use cases

Initialize balances for endowed accounts.

## Overview

Genesis configuration is a useful tool for testing chain behaviour by defining an initial state for things such as accounts, balances, genesis for custom pallets, and more. Here is a simple guide on how to configure custom intial balances for a runtime, by modifying [BalancesConfig][balances-config-rustdocs] in `chainspec.rs`.

## Steps

### 1. Modify accounts

In `chain_spec.rs`, modify the accounts-to-amount map to apply it to the set of all endowed accounts (this is how every node template is set up):

```rust
 pallet_balances: Some(BalancesConfig {
		balances: endowed_accounts.iter().cloned().map(|k|(k, 1 << 60)).collect(),
}),
```

Alternatively, write out each account you would like to pre-seed, as shown below:

```rust
pallet_balances: Some(BalancesConfig {
		balances: vec![ (
		get_account_id_from_seed::<sr25519::Public>("Alice"),
		1 << 60
		),
		(
		get_account_id_from_seed::<sr25519::Public>("Bob"),
		1 << 60
		),
		],
}),
```

### 2. Modify balances

By changing the right-hand-side value of the `balances` tuple, you can customize the amount of each account. Take a look at the [Rust documentation][genesis-config-rustdocs] on how this is implemented. Let's modify things such that Alice's account is pre-seeded with 1<<10:

```rust
pallet_balances: Some(BalancesConfig {
		balances: vec![ (
		get_account_id_from_seed::<sr25519::Public>("Alice"),
		1 << 10  // <---- shift 10 decimals: 1024
		),
		],
}),
```
