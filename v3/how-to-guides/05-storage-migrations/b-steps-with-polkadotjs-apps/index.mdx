        It assumes that migration code is already written and that the new runtime has already been compiled.

## Steps

### 1. Add custom types

In the Polkadot-js apps UI, go to `Settings > Developer` to add your custom types from `types.json`. You can either upload the file directly or paste the types right into the UI. Save it to add them.

### 2. Upload your runtime

In `Developer > Sudo`, make a `system.setCode` call by uploading your runtime (for example, `./target/release/wbuild/node-template-runtime/node_template_runtime.compact.wasm`).

Check the _"with weight override"_ toggle to ignore block weights and set it to some arbitrary value.

### 3. Trigger the call

Hit _"Submit Sudo Unchecked"_ and sign the transaction to trigger the call.
