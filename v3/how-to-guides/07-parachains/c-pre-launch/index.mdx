## Steps

### 1. Set a unique `protocolId`

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Network collisions can cause major headaches`}
  text={`
_All_ chains should use a **unique** \`protocolId\` that _no other network_ (testnets, relay chain,
parachains, etc) uses. This ensures your nodes do not incorrectly peer with
nodes from other libp2p networks. You want to isolate them to a distinct peer group with this ID.
Protocol ID collisions will cause _many_ issues for your nodes!
`}
/>

In order to set a unique protocol ID, change make sure you use some nonce or salt value. This is set
(for the [parachain node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/))
as a CLI item in `/client/network/src/command.rs`, and passed to extend the `/client/network/src/chain_spec.rs`

All [chain specification](/v3/runtime/chain-specs) files include this item as a field. For example,
the primary [relay chain
runtime](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
chain specs have unique protocol IDs. For Polkadot:

```json
// raw chain spec file in polkadot repo `/node/service/res/polkadot.json`
{
  //--snip--
  "protocolId": "dot"
  //--snip--
}
```

Keep an eye (subscribe)
to [this issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7746)
that will address a better method to safely configure this constant in the future.

### 2. Memory profiling

[Profiling your collator](/v3/tools/memory-profiling) should be done to analyze memory leaks,
identify where memory consumption is happening, define temporary allocations, and investigate
excessive memory fragmentation within applications.

### 3. Minimize your runtime size

When launching a parachain, it is critical to use the **compressed version of the runtime** to lower
the amount of resource consumption as much as possible for the relay chain.

- It is recommended to launch a parachain with limited functionality and gradually increase it with
  runtime upgrades. The reason behind that is that during a runtime upgrade both the previous runtime
  and the new runtime are included in the PoVBlock and therefore if the changes are large enough the
  block might be rejected by the Relay Chain due to PoVBlock size limits.

- If the runtime is included in the state proof, ensure the PoV block (i.e. the set of extrinsics,
  including the new runtime, the PoV state proof, potentially the old runtime) fits within the
  PoVBlock size limit. If the runtime is not included in the state proof, the size limit of the new
  runtime will be much higher.

You can check the maximum sizes [in the Polkadot
repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/primitives/src/v1/mod.rs#L247-L253)
for all relay chains (these are common constants). Make note of:
- The runtime version of the relay chain you are targeting (these _may_ change)
- \`MAX_CODE_SIZE\`
- \`MAX_HEAD_DATA_SIZE\`
- \`MAX_POV_SIZE\`
\n
You **must** have your parachain fit comfortably within these maxima.
You can also use the the Polkadot-JS Apps UI connected to a relay node to see these
constants: _Developers_ -> _ParachainsConfiguration_ -> _ActiveConfiguration_

### 4. Use proper weights

Use [runtime benchmarking](/v3/runtime/benchmarking) to ensure that your runtime weights are
actually indicative of the resources used by your runtime.

#### Custom weights

If you need to diverge from benchmarks, make sure that each pallet in your runtime employs the
correct weighting system. Default and "guessed at" weights **are not** to be used in production, as
a general rule.

#### Set block weight limit

It is recommended to have a block weight limit (block production time) of 0.5 seconds in the
beginning due to uncertainties in block execution time. As the execution time of the network
stabilizes the weight limit can be increased to 2 seconds.

### 5. Setup call filters

Especially when launching a parachain, you might need to highly constrict what is enabled for
_specific classes_ of users. This can be accomplished with **call filters**.

<Message

  title={`Call Filter Examples`}
  text={`
Here you can see an example of how to
[limit](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/blob/59cdbb6a56b1c49009413d66ba2232494563b57c/polkadot-parachains/statemine/src/lib.rs#L148)

functionality with filters as implemented in
the [Statemine runtime deployment](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/476).
`}
/>

### 6. Incremental runtime deployments

If you are approaching limits outline above before launch (like a too-large large runtime) it is
highly advisable to prune down functionality as much as practical and **incrementally upgrade**.
In these cases, you can:

1. Generate the genesis state of your chain with full runtime functionality (including all the pallets)

2. Remove all pallets that you will not need upon parachain launch from your runtime

3. Re-build the WASM blob (validation logic) and the runtime of the chain

4. Register your parachain with the updated genesis and the WASM blob generated in (3)

5. After your parachain is live you can upgrade your runtime on-chain to include the missing pallets
   (ensure that pallet indices and names match those used to generate the genesis state in step (1)
   without having to do storage migrations. For more information on on-chain runtime upgrades refer to
   the next section.

**See the [parachain runtime upgrade guide](/how-to-guides/v3/parachains/runtime-upgrades)** for how
to go about actually performing these incremental runtime upgrades.

### 7. Launch simulation

Before you try anything on a production testnet or mainnet, be sure to _as close as possible_
simulate the behavior of a mock network to launch your chain.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`You need to test!`}
  text={`
See the [cumulus tutorial](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay) to learn the \`polkadot-launch\` tool
for such testing.
\n
Also keep in mind that testing in a confined small dummy network will tests your failure modes in a
real network with latency and many collators and validators. The closer you can get to testing this
in the same environment, the more sure you can be that your runtime upgrades will not fail.
