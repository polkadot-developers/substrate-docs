## Goal

- Reserve a ParaID

## Use cases

Launching a parachain.

## Overview

You need a ParaID/slot number to perform any operation referencing your
parachain/parathread. For example, for providing the WASM blob/genesis state,
creating channels to other parachains for XCM, starting a crowdloan, etc.

## Steps

### 1. Reserve a ParaID

- Click on "Network" - "Parachains" in the apps UI.

- Go to the "Parathread" tab and clock on "+ParaID" (a parachain cycle always
  begins with a parathread)

- Reserve the ParaID. This operation requires a deposit.
