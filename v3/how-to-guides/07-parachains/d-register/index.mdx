## Goal

- Generate parachain genesis state
- Generate and compress WASM validation logic
- Register the parachain on the Relay Chain
- Calculate deposit for the transaction

## Use cases

Launching a Parachain.

## Overview

Launching a Parachain requires a series of steps to ensure that the Relay Chain
knows exactly what is the Parachain Runtime Logic once this Parachain gets a
slot on the Relay Chain. In order to achieve this, you will need to have
previously successfully [generated a ParaID][register-paraid]. After
successfully registering your Parachain, you will be able to start your
[Crowdloan][crowdloan-paraid]

## Steps

To register your parachain you need to provide your ParaID, genesis state and
your compressed WASM validation logic.

- Generate
  [parachain Genesis state](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/pt2#3-generate-parachain-genesis-state)
- [Obtain WASM runtime validation logic](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/pt2#4-obtain-wasm-runtime-validation-function).
  maximum size of the WASM blob is 750 kilobytes on Kusama
- Compress WASM validation logic
- [Register the parachain](/tutorials/v3/cumulus/pt2#parachain-registration).
  This transaction requires a deposit. The amount of the deposit depends on the
  size of the WASM blob and the genesis states.
- Check and calculate the exact formulas for deposit calculation for
