        `[Randomness](/v3/runtime/randomness)is useful in computer programs for everything from gaming applications to selecting block
        authors. True randomness is hard to come by in deterministic computers. This is particularly true in the context
        of a blockchain when all the nodes in the network must agree on the state of the chain. FRAME provides runtime engineers
        with a source of randomness, using the [Randomness trait](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/traits/trait.Randomness.html).
        This guide would step you through making use of FRAME's Randomness trait by using it's \`random\` method and a nonce as a subject.
        For additional entropy to the randomness value, the last step shows how to assign the \`RandomCollectiveFlip\` pallet
        to the configuration trait of a pallet exposing some "random" type.

## Steps

### 1. Import `Randomness`

Inside the pallet you want to use, import the `Randomness` trait from `frame_support`,:

```rust
use frame_support::traits::Randomness;
```

Now, include it in your pallet's configuration trait:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait frame_system::Config {
    type MyRandomness: Randomness<H256>;
}
```

Notice that the `Randomness` trait specifies a generic return of type `Output`. Use [`sp_core::H256`][h256-rustdocs] in your pallet
to satisfy that trait requirement.

  title={`A warning on using this trait`}

     "As stated in
     [this trait's documentation](/rustdocs/latest/frame_support/traits/trait.Randomness.html)
     at best, this trait can give you randomness which was hard to predict a long time ago 
     but that has become easy to predict recently. 
     Bear this in mind depending on your use case for it.
     "

### 2. Create a nonce

Use a nonce to serve as a subject for the `frame_support::traits::Randomness::random(subject: &[u8])` method.

There's two steps to including a nonce in your pallet:

1. **Create a `Nonce` storage item.** This could be of type `u32` or `u64` (no need for it to be larger).
2. **Create a private nonce function.** This will be used to increment the nonce each time it's used.

The `increment_nonce()` private function could be implemented in such a way that it returns the nonce as well as
updates it. Using this approach it would look like this:

```rust
    fn get_and_increment_nonce() -> Vec<u8> {
        let nonce = Nonce::get();
        Nonce::put(nonce.wrapping_add(1));
        nonce.encode()
    }
```

Rust documentation.
`}/>

### 3. Use Randomness in a dispatchable

Using the nonce, you can call the `random()` method that `Randomness` exposes. The code snippet below is a made up example
that assumes relevant events and storage items have been implemented:

```rust
        #[pallet::weight(100)]
        pub fn create_unique(
			origin: OriginFor<T>)
			-> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {

                // Account calling this dispatchable.
                let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

                // Random value.
				let nonce = Self::get_and_increment_nonce();
                let randomValue = T::MyRandomness::random(&nonce);

                // Write the random value to storage.
                <MyStorageItem<T>>::put(randomValue);

                Self::deposit_event(Event::UniqueCreated(randomValue));
            }
```

### 4. Updating your pallet's runtime implementation

Having added a type to your pallet's configuration trait `Config` opens up the opportunity to further enhance the
randomness derived by the `Randomness` trait, by using the [Randomness Collective Flip pallet][rcf-pallet-rustdocs].

Using this pallet alongside the `Randomness` trait will significantly improve the entropy being processed by `random()`.

In `runtime/src/lib.rs`, assuming `pallet_random_collective_flip` is instantiated in `construct_runtime` as `RandomCollectiveFlip`, specify your exposed
type like this:

```rust
impl my_pallet::Config for Runtime{
    type Event;
    type MyRandomness = RandomCollectiveFlip;
}

```
