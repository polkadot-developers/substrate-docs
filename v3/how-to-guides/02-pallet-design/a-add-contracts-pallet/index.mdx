This guide will show you how to add the [Contracts pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html) to your runtime so that your blockchain can support WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts.

You can follow similar patterns to add additional FRAME pallets to your runtime, however you should note that each pallet is a little different in terms of the specific configuration settings needed to use it correctly.

## What is the Contracts Pallet for?

Broadly speaking there are two big use-cases you can apply it to.
We'll only shortly describe those, for more information please check [the pallet reamde][pallet-readme].

### Smart contracts as first-class citizens

You want to build a general-purpose smart contracts chain, with them being the main focus of your chain.
Maybe you have an innovative idea and want to have a smart contracts base layer which you complement with your chains unique selling point.

### Smart contracts for users to customize how they interact with your chain

You've built a chain that doesn't have smart contracts as first-class citizens, instead most of the logic is built using Substrate pallets.

But now you want to expose limited parts of your chains business logic to be customizable by users. Say you have e.g. a decentralized exchange chain and want to enable users uploading their own trading algorithms.
Smart contracts are ideal for that ‒ they treat all user input as untrusted and potentially adversarial.
With gas fees users have to pay for the execution time of their trading algorithms.

The Contracts pallet provides the [Chain extension][chain-extension] primitive for exactly that.
This way programming languages (like [ink!][ink]) can easily make use of your chains exposed business logic primitives.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the latest version of the Substrate node template compiled on your computer.
If you haven't already done so, see [Create your first substrate chain](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain/).

## Import the dependencies

1. Add the following dependencies to your `runtime/Cargo.toml`:
   - `pallet-contracts`
   - `pallet-contracts-primitives`
   - `pallet-contracts-rpc-runtime-api`
   - `pallet-contracts-rpc`
1. Integrate the Contracts pallet into your runtime as described in the [Basic pallet integration](/how-to-guides/v3/basics/pallet-integration) guide.

## Add the Contracts pallet to your runtime

1. Implement the Contracts pallet [configuration trait][contracts-config-rustdocs] trait for your `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

   You should check that the version of the pallet behind this link is the same as the `Cargo.toml` dependencies for the Contracts pallet.

   Implementing the trait will require you to define the trait types, like so:

   ```rust
   impl pallet_contracts::Config for Runtime {
   	type Time = Timestamp;
   	type Randomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
   	type Currency = Balances;
   	type Event = Event;
   	/* --snip-- */
   ```

   For the Contracts pallet a couple template nodes exist at which you can take a look on how they set up the specific parameters for this pallet:
   * [Substrate repository node][bin-runtime-contracts-config]
   * [`substrate-contracts-node`][substrate-contracts-node] is a standalone node.
   * [`contracts-parachain`][contracts-parachain] is a parachain node.

   The [configuration trait documentation][contracts-config-rustdocs] also has explanations for each type.

1. Add parameter types.

   Note that some of these types require `parameter_types`. To see an example of how they should be added, see [this example][bin-runtime-contracts-frame].

   Add the parameter types directly above `impl pallet_contracts::Config for Runtime`.

   For example, the following snippet shows how the parameter type `DeletionQueueDepth` can be added:

   ```rust
   parameter_types! {
     /* --snip-- */
   	 pub DeletionQueueDepth: u32 = ((DeletionWeightLimit::get() / (
   	   <Runtime as pallet_contracts::Config>::WeightInfo::on_initialize_per_queue_item(1) -
   		 <Runtime as pallet_contracts::Config>::WeightInfo::on_initialize_per_queue_item(0)
   	 )) / 5) as u32;
     /* --snip-- */
   }
   ```

   Notice how the above parameter type depends on `WeightInfo`. This requires you to add the following to the top of `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   use pallet_contracts::weights::WeightInfo;
   ```

   Similarly, other parameter types use constants such as `DAYS`, `MILLICENTS` and `AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO`.

   Define these towards the top of your `runtime/src/lib.rs` file where the other constants exist:

   ```rust
   // Contracts price units.
   // Unit = the base number of indivisible units for balances
   const UNIT: Balance = 1_000_000_000_000;
   const MILLIUNIT: Balance = 1_000_000_000;
   const EXISTENTIAL_DEPOSIT: Balance = MILLIUNIT;

   const fn deposit(items: u32, bytes: u32) -> Balance {
     (items as Balance * UNIT + (bytes as Balance) * (5 * MILLIUNIT / 100)) / 10
   }

   /// We assume that ~10% of the block weight is consumed by `on_initialize` handlers.
   /// This is used to limit the maximal weight of a single extrinsic.
   const AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO: Perbill = Perbill::from_percent(10);
   ```

1. Add an instance of `pallet_contracts` in the runtime.

   Create an instance of the Contracts pallet in the `construct_macro!` inside `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   /* --snip-- */
   Contracts: pallet_contracts,
   /* --snip-- */
   ```

## Add API dependencies

The Contracts pallet exposes custom runtime APIs and RPC endpoints.

An example of such an API + RPC is to execute a contract call as a dry-run ‒ so without actually modifying any storage.
This dry-run is often used by off-chain tooling (e.g. a frontend) to display a contracts state.
Think of an ERC-20 contract, in order to display the balance of an account the frontend would execute a dry-run of the balance function via this RPC.

In order to use the Contracts pallet for this you'll use two other pallets: the Contracts RPC Runtime API pallet and the Contracts RPC pallet.

1. Import the dependencies.

   As in the [first step of this guide](#1-import-the-dependencies), update `runtime/Cargo.toml` to add `pallet-contracts-rpc-runtime-api`.

1. Include `pallet-contracts` and `pallet-contracts-rpc` inside `node/Cargo.toml`.

   This way your runtime can interact with your node.

1. Implement the [`ContractsApi`][contracts-rpc-api-rustdocs] trait.

   Navigate to the `impl_runtime_apis!` macro near the end of your runtime.

   Add the trait implementation inside the macro:

   ```rust
	 impl pallet_contracts_rpc_runtime_api::ContractsApi<Block, AccountId, Balance, BlockNumber, Hash>
		 for Runtime
	 {
	   // TODO: Implement the functions
	 }
   ```

   For the implementation of the individual trait functions it is very unlikely that you want a different implementation than the one used in the templates.
   These functions merely forward the calls to the pallet. You can copy the implementation straight from [Substrate][bin-runtime-contracts-rpc].
   Make sure that the version where you copy from is the same as used in your `Cargo.toml`.

1. Add the RPC API extension.

   The node's RPC does not contain access to the Contracts pallet by default.
   To interact with it, you must extend the existing RPC and add the Contracts pallet along with the API.

   In `node/src/rpc.rs`, search this function:

   ```rust
   /// Instantiate all full RPC extensions.
   pub fn create_full
   ```

   And add the following trait bound to it (in the `where` clause):

   ```rust
   C::Api: pallet_contracts_rpc::ContractsRuntimeApi<Block, AccountId, Balance, BlockNumber, Hash>,
   ```

   In the function body, before the function returns, you need to add the contracts RPC API extension:

   ```rust
 	 // Contracts RPC API extension
   use pallet_contracts_rpc::{ContractsApiServer, ContractsRpc};
	 module.merge(ContractsRpc::new(client.clone()).into_rpc())?;
   ```

1. Storage Migrations

  You should also account for storage migrations.

  The most naive way is to include this code into your `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

  ```rust
  use pallet_contracts::migration;

  pub struct Migrations;
  impl OnRuntimeUpgrade for Migrations {
	  fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> Weight {
		  migration::migrate::<Runtime>()
	  }
  }
  ```

  And you need to adapt your `Executive` type, by adding `Migrations` as a type parrameter:

  ```rust
  pub type Executive = frame_executive::Executive<
    Runtime,
    Block,
    frame_system::ChainContext<Runtime>,
    Runtime,
    AllPalletsWithSystem,
    Migrations,
  >;
  ```

  This is only the most simple solution of how to do storage migrations, if you have a lot of state in your chain the migration might take longer than the time allowed for building a block.
  This would be very bad, since it would effectively brick your chain, since it would be unable to continue building blocks due to always exhausting the slot duration.

  See the how-to guide on [Storage Migrations][storage-migrations-tutorial] for more details on migrations.

## Start your upgraded chain

Your node template now includes the Contracts pallet and is ready to execute WebAssembly smart contracts.

Build and run it using the following commands:

```bash
# Build chain
cargo build --release

# Launch chain in development mode
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

## Examples

These are a couple of repositories that contain node configurations with the Contracts pallet.
In case you want to look up how something can be configured in specific scenarios these node configurations can be helpful.

### Developer Node

[`substrate-contracts-node`][substrate-contracts-node] is a standalone node, based on Substrate's [`node-template`][substrate-node-template].
The node was configured to include the Contracts pallet.
It is tracking Substrate's `master` branch.

This particular node contains a couple of modifications that make it unsuitable for a production deployment, but a great fit for development and testing.
The modifications are described in the readme.

### Parachain Node

The [`contracts-rococo`][contracts-parachain] node has been configured to include the Contracts pallet and be a parachain for Rococo, a testnet for Polkadot and Kusama parachains.
It has been configured as a common good parachain, as such it uses the Rococo relay chain's native token `ROC` instead of defining a token of its own.

### Default Node from Substrate repository

The Substrate repository contains a [node configuration][bin-runtime-contracts-config] that includes all pallets shipped with Substrate.
