## Steps

### 1. Import the dependencies

Refer to [this guide](/how-to-guides/v3/basics/pallet-integration) to properly include Contracts in your runtime.

This includes **updating `runtime/Cargo.toml` and `runtime/Cargo.toml`** with:

- `pallet-contracts`
- `pallet-contracts-primitives`

### 2. Add the Contracts pallet to your runtime

Now you'll have to implement the Contract's pallet [configuration traits][contracts-config-rustdocs] in order for your runtime to use it properly.

#### Implement `pallet_contracts`

Start by making sure you've included all of the types that `pallet_contracts` exposes. You can copy these from [FRAME's source code][contracts-frame-gh]
(always check that versioning is equivalent to the imported crate). Here's what you need to add inside `runtime/src/lib.rs` &mdash; only the first 4 types are shown:

```rust
impl pallet_contracts::Config for Runtime {
    type Time = Timestamp;
    type Randomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
    type Currency = Balances;
    type Event = Event;
    /* --snip-- */
```

#### Parameter types

Notice how some of these types require `parameter_types`. Have a look at their implementation in [this][bin-runtime-contracts-frame]
runtime to make sure you've included them correctly. They go right above `impl pallet_contracts::Config for Runtime`.
We'll take `DeletionQueueDepth` as one example &mdash; go ahead and add them in:

```rust
parameter_types! {
     /* --snip-- */
	pub DeletionQueueDepth: u32 = ((DeletionWeightLimit::get() / (
			<Runtime as pallet_contracts::Config>::WeightInfo::on_initialize_per_queue_item(1) -
			<Runtime as pallet_contracts::Config>::WeightInfo::on_initialize_per_queue_item(0)
		    )) / 5) as u32;
        /* --snip-- */
    }
```

Notice how the above parameter type depends on `WeightInfo`. This requires you to add the following to the top of `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use pallet_contracts::weights::WeightInfo;
```

Similarly, other parameter types use constants such as `DAYS`, `MILLICENTS` and `AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO`.

Define these towards the top of your `runtime/src/lib.rs` file where the other constants exist:

```rust
// Contracts price units.
pub const MILLICENTS: Balance = 1_000_000_000;
pub const CENTS: Balance = 1_000 * MILLICENTS;
pub const DOLLARS: Balance = 100 * CENTS;

const fn deposit(items: u32, bytes: u32) -> Balance {
    items as Balance * 15 * CENTS + (bytes as Balance) * 6 * CENTS
}

/// We assume that ~10% of the block weight is consumed by `on_initalize` handlers.
/// This is used to limit the maximal weight of a single extrinsic.
const AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO: Perbill = Perbill::from_percent(10);
```

#### Add an instance in runtime for `pallet_contracts`

Create an instance of the Contracts pallet in `construct_macro!` inside `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
/* --snip-- */
 Contracts: pallet_contracts::{Pallet, Call, Config<T>, Storage, Event<T>},
 /* --snip-- */
```

### 3. Add API dependencies

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Information`}
  text={`The Contracts pallet exposes custom runtime APIs and RPC endpoints
  which enables reading a contracts state from off chain. Since we want to use 
  the Contracts pallet to make calls to our node's storage without making a transaction, 
  we'll two other pallets: the Contracts RPC Runtime API pallet and the Contracts RPC pallet 
  to help us achieve this.`}
/>

#### Import dependencies

1. Just like in the [first step of this guide](#1-import-the-dependencies), update `/runtime/Cargo.toml` to add `pallet-contracts-rpc-runtime-api`.

2. Similarly, we need to include `pallet-contracts` and `pallet-contracts-rpc` inside `node/Cargo.toml` so that our runtime can interact with our node.

Now we can add the [`ContractsApi`][contracts-api-rustdocs] dependency required to implement the Contracts runtime API.

Add this alongside the other `use` statements in `node/src/rpc.rs`:

```rust
use pallet_contracts_rpc::{Contracts, ContractsApi};
```
<br />
<Message type='green' title='Tip' text={`
Unsure what version to import? Use the latest version as indicated in
[crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=pallet-contracts-rpc).
`}/>

#### Implement the Contracts runtime API

We're now ready to implement the Contracts
runtime API.

This happens in the
`impl_runtime_apis! `macro near the end of your
runtime.

Make sure to add the following functions that the `ContractsApi` exposes:

- **`call()`**: returns `pallet_contracts_primitives::ContractExecResult { Contracts::bare_call(origin, dest, value, gas_limit, input_data)}`
- **`get_storage()`**: returns `pallet_contracts_primitives::GetStorageResult {Contracts::get_storage(address, key)}`
- **`rent_projection()`**: returns `pallet_contracts_primitives::RentProjectionResult<BlockNumber> {Contracts::rent_projection(address)}`

#### Add RPC API extension

To be able to call the runtime API, we must add the RPC to the node's service.

This RPC does not contain access to the Contracts pallet by default. To interact with it, we have to **extend the existing RPC and add the Contracts pallet** along with its API.

In `node/src/rpc.rs`, add this line to the `where` clause in `create_full<C, P>`:

```rust
 C::Api: pallet_contracts_rpc::ContractsRuntimeApi<Block, AccountId, Balance, BlockNumber>,
```

And add the contracts RPC API extension using:

```rust
 // Contracts RPC API extension
   io.extend_with(
       ContractsApi::to_delegate(Contracts::new(client.clone()))
   );
```

### 4. Start your upgraded chain

Your node template now includes the Contracts pallet and is ready to execute WASM smart contracts.

Build and run it using:

```rust
# Build chain
cargo build --release
# Launch chain in development mode
./target/release/node-template --dev --tmp
```
