        `Tight coupling two pallets may suit specific use cases where the outside pallet 
         contains many types and methods common to those of the initial pallet. If this is not 
         the case, it's recommended to use loose coupling instead. Read more about pallet 
         coupling [here](/v3/runtime/pallet-coupling).`,

## Steps

### 1. Configure your workspace

Assume you want to use a pallet called `special-pallet`, which is a pallet in your 
local workspace. Import it by providing its path in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
special-pallet = { path = '../special-pallet', default-features = false }
```

### 2. Add a trait bound to your pallet 

Now all you need to do is create a trait bound around your pallet's configuration trait:

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + special_pallet::Config {
    // --snip--
}
```

### 3. Use getter function 

In order to use a method from `special_pallet`, call it the following way:

```rust
// Get the members from the vec-set pallet
let who = special_pallet::Pallet::<T>::get();
```

The above snippet assumes that `special_pallet` contains a method called `get()`.
