## Overview

Off-chain workers (**OCW** for short) were introduced to extend oracle-like capabilities for Substrate blockchains.
Because a blockchain does not have access to data outside its own network, oracles are a useful tool to enable interactions between on and off-chain worlds.

In this guide we will look through retrieving the price of bitcoin from the `cryptocompare` api as well as submitting data via an OCW API.

Remember that although Rust provides various libraries for issuing HTTP requests, an OCW runs in an [no-std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html) environment.
Luckily, Substrate provides us with a few `no_std` libraries we can use to issue HTTP requests to an API. 

The Substrate HTTP library supports the following methods:
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

## Steps

1. Create a deadline of 2 seconds

  ```rust
  // We want to keep the offchain worker execution time reasonable, so we set a hard-coded
  // deadline to 2s to complete the external call.
  // You can also wait indefinitely for the response, however you may still get a timeout
  // coming from the host machine.
  let deadline = sp_io::offchain::timestamp().add(Duration::from_millis(2_000));
  ```

2. Initiate an external HTTP GET request

  ```rust
  // Initiate an external HTTP GET request.
  let request = http::Request::get("https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD");
  let pending = request.deadline(deadline).send().map_err(|_| http::Error::IoError)?;
  let response = pending.try_wait(deadline).map_err(|_| http::Error::DeadlineReached)??;
  ```

3. Check the response

  ```rust
  // Let's check the status code before we proceed to reading the response.
  if response.code != 200 {
    log::warn!("Unexpected status code: {}", response.code);
    return Err(http::Error::Unknown)
  }
  ```

4. Read the response

  ```rust
  let body = response.body().collect::<Vec<u8>>();
  // Create a str slice from the body.
  let body_str = sp_std::str::from_utf8(&body).map_err(|_| {
    log::warn!("No UTF8 body");
    http::Error::Unknown
  })?;
  ```

5. Submit data to an API via a POST request

  ```rust
   // Send a POST request
  let request_body = Vec::new();
  let request = http::Request::post("https://reqres.in/api/users", vec![request_body.clone()])
    .add_header("x-api-key", "test_api_key")
    .add_header("content-type", "application/json");

  let pending = request
    .deadline(deadline)
    .body(vec![request_body.clone()])
    .send()
    .map_err(|_| http::Error::IoError)?;

  // Wait for response
  let response = pending
    .try_wait(deadline)
    .map_err(|_| http::Error::DeadlineReached)??;
  ```
