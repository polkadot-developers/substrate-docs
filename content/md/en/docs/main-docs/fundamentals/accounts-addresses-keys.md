An account represents an identity—usually of a person or an organization—that is capable of making transactions or holding funds.
Although accounts are most often used to represent a person, that doesn't have to be the case.
An account can be used to perform operations on behalf of a user or another entity, or to perform operations autonomously.
In addition, any single person or entity could have multiple accounts for different purposes. 
For example, Polkadot is a Substrate=based blockchain that has specialized accounts for holding funds that are separate from accounts used for making transactions.
How you implement and use accounts is entirely up to you as a blockchain or parachain developer.

## Public and private keys

In general, every account has an owner who possesses a public and private key pair.
The **private key** is a cryptographically-secure sequence of randomly-generated numbers. For human readability, the private key generates a random sequence of words called a **secret seed phrase** or **mnemonic**.
This secret seed phrase can be used an account owner to recover access to an account if the private key is lost.

For most networks, the **public key** associated with an account is how that account is identified on the network and is used as the destination address for transactions.
However, Substrate-based chains use the underlying public key to derive one or more **public addresses**.
Instead of using the public key directly, Substrate allows you generate multiple addresses and address formats for an account.

## Address encoding and chain-specific addresses

Substrate enables you to use a single public key to derive multiple addresses so you can interact with multiple chains without creating separate public and private key pairs for each network.
By default, the addresses associated with the public key for an account use the Substrate **SS58 address format**.
This address format is based on [base-58 encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html).
TIn addition to allowing you to derive multiple addresses from the same public key, base-58 encoding has the following benefits:

* Encoded addresses consist of 58 alphanumeric characters.
* The alphanumeric string omits characters—such as `0`, `O`, `I`, and `l`—that can be difficult to distinguish from each other in a string.
* Network information—for example, a network-specific prefix—can be encoded in the address.
* Input errors can be detected using a checksum to ensure the address is entered correctly.

Because a single public key can be used to derive addresses for different Substrate chains, a single account can multiple chain-specific addresses.
For example, if you inspect the addresses for the `alice` account public key `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d` depends on the chain-specific address type.

| Chain address type | Address 
| ------------ | ------ 
| Polkadot (SS58)| 15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5
| Kusama (SS58) | HNZata7iMYWmk5RvZRTiAsSDhV8366zq2YGb3tLH5Upf74F
| Generic Substrate chain (SS58)| 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY

Each Substrate blockchain can register a custom prefix to create a chain-specific address type.
For example, all Polkadot addresses start with `1` and all Kusama addresses start with a capital letter.
All unregistered Substrate chains start with `5`.

You can look the a chain-specific address for a public key using the `subkey inspect` commmand and `--network` option ot by using [Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/format_transform).

## Account information in FRAME

Conceptually, accounts represent identities that have a public/private key pair with one or more public addresses.
However, in a runtime built with FRAME, an account is defined as a storage map with a 32-byte address identifier and corresponding account information, such as the number of transactions the account has made, the number of modules that depend on the account, and account balance.

The account properties—such as the `AccountId`—can be defined generically in the `frame_system` module.
The generic type is then resolved as a specific type in the runtime implementation, and eventually assigned a specific value.
For example, the `Account` type in FRAME relies on an associated `AccountId` type. The `AccountId` type remains a generic type until it is assigned a type in the runtime implementation for a pallet that needs this information.

For more information about how accounts are defined in the `frame_system` pallet and the account properties in the `Account` storage map, see [Account data structures](/reference/account-properties/).
For more information about working with generic types, see [Rust for Substrate](/main-docs/fundamentals/rust-basics/#generic-types).

## Specialized accounts

Although most accounts are used to represent a public/private key pair that controls funds or executes transactions, Substrate supports some specialized accounts to control how specific key pairs can be used.
For example, you might have accounts that require custom cryptographic schemes, can only be used to perform specific functions, or can only access specific pallets.

### Staking accounts and keys

In most cases, specialized accounts are implemented in the context of a specific FRAME pallet.
For example, nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) can require node validators and nominators to hold a significant number of tokens.
To keep the balances in these accounts secure, the Staking pallet provides some account abstractions that separate the key pairs required to perform specific operations.

| Account type | How the account is used
| -------- | ----------- 
| Stash account | The **stash account** represents the public/private key pair that defines a staking balance for validators. You should keep stash account keys offline and in cold storage for security. You should not use the stash account to make frequent transactions. because the keys for this account are kept offline, you can designate a **controller account** to make non-spending decisions or a **keyless proxy account** to vote in governance on its behalf. |
| Controller account | The controller account represents the public/private key pair that signals your intent to validate or nominate, sets preferences like the rewards destination and, in the case of validators, sets the session keys. A controller account only needs to pay transaction fees, so it only needs minimal funds. It can never be used to spend funds from its stash account. Actions taken by the controller can result in slashing, so it should still be well secured.
| Session account | The session account represents the public/private key pair used by validators to sign consensus-related messages. The session account is not intended to control funds. These keys are also defined generically in the [Session pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_session/index.html) and made concrete in the runtime. To create the session account key pair, you must attest that the account acts on behalf of your stash account and nominators by signing a transaction with your controller key and publishing the session certificate on the chain. You can generate and register new session keys on chain using a [`session.setKeys`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_session/struct.Module.html#method.set_keys) transaction. You can change session keys using the [`author_rotateKeys`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_rpc/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.rotate_keys) RPC call.

### Keyless proxy accounts

In some cases, you might want to create an account that is detached from any owner so that it can be used to perform autonomous transactions.
For example, you might create an account, then delegate permissions to that account so that it can dispatch function calls without your intervention and without access to your keys.
After the new account with the delegated permissions is created, the account can be used as a recipient to burn funds or to hold tokens awaiting the execution or a transfer.

You can use the Proxy pallet to create an account with permission to dispatch certain types of calls using the delegated account as the signed origin.

## Where to go next

In Substrate, accounts require a public key and a private key to receive funds, sign transactions, and execute transactions.
At a high level, there are three types of accounts:

* User accounts that enable end users to interact with the blockchain.
* Network accounts that provide additional security for validators and nominators by restricting some operations for staking and governance.
* Pallet accounts that are executed by valid origins to perform pallet-specific operations.
