Before you can start developing a Substrate-based blockchain, you need to prepare your development environment with the required compiler and tools.
Because Substrate—and most of the developer tools for working with Substrate—are written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, the first step in preparing your computer is to install Rust.
The steps for installing Rust depend on the operating system of the computer you are using for Substrate development.
For installation instructions, see the appropriate topic for your operating system.

- [Linux](/main-docs/install/linux/)
- [macOS](/main-docs/install/macos/)
- [Windows](/main-docs/install/windows/)

If you already have Rust installed, you can skip the installation instructions.
For additional information about installing and upgrading the Rust compiler and toolchain or troubleshooting installation issues, see the following topics:

- [Rust toolchain](/main-docs/install/rust-builds/)
- [Developer tools](/main-docs/install//other-tools/)
- [Troubleshooting common issues](/main-docs/install/troubleshooting/)
