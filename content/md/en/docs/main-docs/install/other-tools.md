Because you are going to be writing code in Rust, be sure your development environment has the appropriate extensions and plug-ins for working with Rust.
As yo begin working with the Substrate node template, you'll see that it includes a core set of features and tools specifically designed for runtime development.
However, there are also many other specialized tools available that you can install to complement and extend your development environment or to handle specific tasks.

For an overview of some of the most commonly-used tools, see [command-line tools](/reference/command-line-tools/).
