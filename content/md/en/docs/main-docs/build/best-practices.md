## Blockchain-specific best practices

- write efficient code
- simple or complex functions
- minimize database reads/writes
- be mindful of constraints (processing time for computation, network bandwidth, storage, memory)

## Rust and Substrate-specific syntax

- Examples of good APIs
- Examples of using extrinsics
- Examples of using storage
- using `saturated_add` or `checked_add` for arithmetic operations.
- error checking.
- writing tests.
