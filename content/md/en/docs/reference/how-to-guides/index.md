Substrate _How-to_ quick reference guides provide instructions for achieving specific goals.
Each guide explains how to perform a specific task with the assumption that you are already familiar with Substrate and programming in Rust.

## Basics

See the following guides to learn common patterns in runtime development.

- [Customize a chain specification](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/customize-a-chain-specification)
- [Use helper functions](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/use-helper-functions)

## Pallet design

See the following guides for best practices on building pallets using FRAME.
