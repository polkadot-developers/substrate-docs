Substrate _How-to_ quick reference guides provide instructions for achieving specific goals.
Each guide explains how to perform a specific task with the assumption that you are already familiar with Substrate and programming in Rust.
Learn more about contributing to these guides [here](/community/contribute/templates).

## Basics
  
See the following guides to learn common patterns in runtime development.

- [Import a pallet](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/pallet-integration/)
- [Configure runtime constants](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/runtime-constants/)
- [Configure genesis](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/genesis-config)
- [Custom chain specification](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/custom-chainspec)
- [Use helper functions](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/helper-functions)
- [Mint primitive tokens](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/mint-tokens/)
<!--- [Calculate weight](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/calc-weights/)-->

## Pallet design
  
See the following guides for best practices on building pallets using FRAME.
