This section contains links to the Rust API documentation and technical reference materials for Substrate and FRAME tools and libraries.

[Glossary](/reference/glossary) defines and explains concepts and terminology that are specific to blockchain technology or the Substrate ecosystem.

[Command-line tools](/reference/command-line-tools) provides reference information for the most commonly-used command-line interface (CLI) tools.

[FRAME pallets](/reference/frame-pallets) lists all of the pre-built pallets that you can include in your runtime.

[FRAME macros](/reference/frame-macros) describes the all of the FRAME macros you can use to build custom pallets.

[Account data structures](/reference/account-properties) describes account-related data structures and how account properties are used to manage the account lifecycle in the runtime logic.

[Type encoding (SCALE)](/reference/scale-codec) describes the encoding scheme used in Substrate to minimize the data transferred over the network.

[Rust API]() links to the Rust documentation that is generated directly from the source code for Substrate.

[How-to reference guides](/reference/how-to-guides) lists the _How-to_ quick reference guides that provide abbreviated instructions for accomplishing specific tasks. 
The _How-to_ guides assume that you are already familiar with Substrate and programming in Rust.

[Cryptography](/reference/cryptography) provides a conceptual overview of the cryptography used in Substrate.
