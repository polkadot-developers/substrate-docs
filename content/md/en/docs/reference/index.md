This section contains links to the Rust API documentation and technical reference materials for Substrate and FRAME tools and libraries.

- [Glossary](/reference/glossary) defines and explains concepts and terminology that are specific to blockchain technology or the Substrate ecosystem.

- [Command-line tools](/reference/command-line-tools) provides reference information for the most commonly-used command-line interface (CLI) tools.

- [Runtime APIs](/reference/runtime-apis/) highlights the application programming interfaces that the runtime provides to support communication with outer node services.

- [FRAME pallets](/reference/frame-pallets) lists all of the pre-built pallets that you can include in your runtime.

- [FRAME macros](/reference/frame-macros) describes the all of the FRAME macros you can use to build custom pallets.

- [Account data structures](/reference/account-data-structures/) describes account-related data structures and how account properties are used to manage the account lifecycle in the runtime logic.

- [Type encoding (SCALE)](/reference/scale-codec) describes the encoding scheme used in Substrate to minimize the data transferred over the network.

- [How-to reference guides](/reference/how-to-guides) lists the _How-to_ quick reference guides that provide abbreviated instructions for accomplishing specific tasks.
  The _How-to_ guides assume that you are already familiar with Substrate and programming in Rust.

- [Cryptography](/reference/cryptography) provides an overview of the hashing algorithms and signature schemes used for cryptography in Substrate.

- [XCM reference](/reference/xcm-reference) provides basic reference information for the cross-consensus message format, including descriptions of XCM instructions, registers, origins, and errors.
