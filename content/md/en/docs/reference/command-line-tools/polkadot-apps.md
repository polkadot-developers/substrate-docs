The Polkadot-JS Apps is a flexible UI for interacting with a Polkadot or Substrate based node.
Go to [documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs).

This is pre-built [user-facing application](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps), allowing access to all features available on Substrate chains.

To connect the Polkadot-JS Apps to your local node, you must go into `Settings` and change the
"endpoint to connect to" to `Local Node (127.0.0.1:9944)`.

If you are connected to the Polkadot-JS Apps over a secure HTTPS connection, you will need to use a browser which also supports bridging to an insecure WebSocket endpoint.
For example, Google Chrome supports this, but Mozilla Firefox does not.

## Polkadot-JS extension

The Polkadot-JS Extension is a simple proof-of-concept for managing accounts in a browser extension and allowing the signing of extrinsics using these accounts.
It also provides a simple interface for interacting with extension-compliant dApps.

Different ways to use the extension:

- [On Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)

- [On Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension)

- [Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension)
