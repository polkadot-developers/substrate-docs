The `try-runtime` tool is built to query a snapshot of runtime storage, using an [in-memory-externalities](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html) to store state.
In this way, it enables runtime engineers to write tests for a specified runtime state, for testing against real chain state _before_ going to production.
It is designed to be used as a command line interface to specify at which block to query state.

In its simplest form, `try-runtime` is a tool that enables:

1. Connecting to a remote node and calling into some runtime API.
2. Scraping the specified state from a node at a given block.
3. Writing tests for that data.

## Motivation

The initial motivation for `try-runtime` came from the need to test runtime changes against state from a real chain.
Prior [`TestExternalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html) and [`BasicExternalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.BasicExternalities.html) existed
for writing unit and integrated tests with mock data, but lacked an avenue to test against a chain's actual state.
`try-runtime` extends `TestExternalities` and `BasicExternalities` by scraping state (which is stored with key value pairs) via a node's RPC endpoints [`getStorage`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/remote_externalities/trait.RpcApiClient.html#method.get_storage) and [`getKeysPaged`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/remote_externalities/trait.RpcApiClient.html#method.get_keys_paged) and inserting them into `TestExternalities`.

## How it works

The `try-runtime` tool has its own implementation of externalities called [`remote_externalities`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/remote_externalities/index.html) which is just a builder wrapper around `TestExternalities` that uses a generic [key-value store](/main-docs/fundamentals/state-transitions-and-storage) where data is [type encoded](/reference/scale-codec).

The diagram below illustrates the way externalities sits outside a compiled runtime as a means to capture the storage of that runtime.

### Testing with externalities

With `remote_externalities`, developers can capture some chain state and run tests on it. Essentially, `RemoteExternalities` will populate a `TestExternalities` with a real chain's data.

In order to query state, `try-runtime` makes use of Substrate's RPCs, namely [`StateApi`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_rpc/state/trait.StateApi.html).
In particular:

- [`storage`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_rpc/state/trait.StateApi.html#tymethod.storage): A method which returns a storage value under the given key.
- [`storage_key_paged`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_rpc/state/trait.StateApi.html#tymethod.storage_keys_paged): A method which returns the keys with prefix with pagination support.

## Usage

The most common use case for `try-runtime` is with storage migrations and runtime upgrades.

There are a number of flags that need to be preferably set on a running node in order to work well with try-runtimeâ€™s expensive RPC queries, namely:

- `set --rpc-max-payload 1000` to ensure large RPC queries can work.
- `set --rpc-cors all` to ensure ws connections can come through.

You can combine `try-runtime` with [`fork-off-substrate`](https://github.com/maxsam4/fork-off-substrate) to test your chain before production.
Use `try-runtime` to test your chain's migration and its pre and post states.
Then, use `fork-off-substrate` if you want to check that block production continues after the migration.

### Calling into hooks from `OnRuntimeUpgrade`

By default, there are two ways of defining a runtime upgrade in the runtime.
The [`OnRuntimeUpgrade`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/traits/trait.OnRuntimeUpgrade.html) trait provides the different methods to achieve this.

- **From inside a runtime**. For example:

  ```rust
  struct Custom;
  	impl OnRuntimeUpgrade for Custom {
  		fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> Weight {
  		// -- snip --
  	}
  }
  ```

- **From inside a pallet**. For example:

  ```rust
  #[pallet::hooks]
  impl<T: Config> Hooks<BlockNumberFor<T>> for Pallet<T> {
  	fn on_runtime_upgrade() -> Weight {
  	// -- snip --
  	}
  }
  ```

These hooks will specify _what should happen upon a runtime upgrade_. For testing purposes, we prefer having hooks that allow us to inspect the state _before_ and _after_ a runtime upgrade as well.

These hooks are not available by default, and are only available under a specific feature flag, named `try-runtime`.

The new hooks are as follows:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
fn pre_upgrade() -> Result<(), &'static str> { Ok(()) }

#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
fn post_upgrade() -> Result<(), &'static str> { Ok(()) }
```

### Helper functions

[`OnRuntimeUpgradeHelpersExt`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/traits/trait.OnRuntimeUpgradeHelpersExt.html) are a set of helper functions made available from
[`frame_support::hooks`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/traits/trait.Hooks.html) in order to use `try-runtime` for testing storage migrations.
These include:

- **`storage_key`**: Generates a storage key unique to this runtime upgrade. This can be used to communicate data from pre-upgrade to post-upgrade state and check them.
- **`set_temp_storage`**: Writes some temporary data to a specific storage that can be read (potentially in the post-upgrade hook).
- **`get_temp_storage`** : Gets temporary storage data written by `set_temp_storage`.

Using the [`frame_executive::Executive`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_executive/struct.Executive.html) struct, these helper functions in action would look like:

```rust
pub struct CheckTotalIssuance;
impl OnRuntimeUpgrade for CheckTotalIssuance {
	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn post_upgrade() {
		// iterate over all accounts, sum their balance and ensure that sum is correct.
	}
}
	
pub struct EnsureAccountsWontDie;
impl OnRuntimeUpgrade for EnsureAccountsWontDie {
	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn pre_upgrade() {
		let account_count = frame_system::Accounts::<Runtime>::iter().count();
		Self::set_temp_storage(account_count, "account_count");
	}

	#[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
	fn post_upgrade() {
		// ensure that this migration doesn't kill any account.
		let post_migration = frame_system::Accounts::<Runtime>::iter().count();
		let pre_migration = Self::get_temp_storage::<u32>("account_count");
		ensure!(post_migration == pre_migration, "error ...");
	}
}

pub type CheckerMigrations = (EnsureAccountsWontDie, CheckTotalIssuance);
pub type Executive = Executive<_, _, _, _, (CheckerMigrations)>;
```

### CLI interface

To use `try-runtime` from the command line, run your node with the `--features=try-runtime` flag.

The possible sub-commands include:

- **`on-runtime-upgrade`**: Executes "tryRuntime_on_runtime_upgrade" against the given runtime state.
- **`offchain-worker`**: Executes "offchainWorkerApi_offchain_worker" against the given runtime state.
- **`execute-block`**: Executes "core_execute_block" using the given block and the runtime state of the parent block.
- **`follow-chain`**: Follows a given chain's finalized blocks and applies to all its extrinsics. This allows the behavior of a new runtime to be inspected over a long period of time, with real transactions coming as input.

For example, running `try-runtime` with the "on-runtime-upgrade" subcommand on a chain running locally:

```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime on-runtime-upgrade live ws://localhost:9944
```

#### Other scenarios

Using it to re-execute code from a `ElectionProviderMultiPhase` offchain worker on `localhost:9944`:

```bash
cargo run -- --release \
   --features=try-runtime \
   try-runtime \
   --execution Wasm \
   --wasm-execution Compiled \
   offchain-worker \
   --header-at 0x491d09f313c707b5096650d76600f063b09835fd820e2916d3f8b0f5b45bec30 \
   live \
   -b 0x491d09f313c707b5096650d76600f063b09835fd820e2916d3f8b0f5b45bec30 \
   -m ElectionProviderMultiPhase
   --uri wss://localhost:9944
```

You can pass in the `--help` flag after each subcommand to see the command's different options.

Run the migrations of the local runtime on the state of SomeChain, for example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=runtime=trace,try-runtime::cli=trace,executor=trace \
   cargo run try-runtime \
   --execution Native \
   --chain somechain-dev \
   on-runtime-upgrade \
   live \
   --uri wss://rpc.polkadot.io
```

Running it at a specific block number's state:

```bash
RUST_LOG=runtime=trace,try-runtime::cli=trace,executor=trace \
   cargo run try-runtime \
   --execution Native \
   --chain dev \
   --no-spec-name-check \
   on-runtime-upgrade \
   live \
   --uri wss://rpc.polkadot.io \
   --at <block-hash>
```

> Notice `--no-spec-name-check` in particular is needed.
