The `try-runtime` command-line tool enables you to query a snapshot of runtime storage using an [in-memory-externalities](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html) data structure to store state.
With this tool, you can write tests against a snapshot of the runtime state _before_ going to production.

## Basic command usage

The basic syntax for running `try-runtime` commands is:

```shell
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime [options] [subcommand]
```

Depending on the subcommand you specify, additional arguments, options, and flags might apply or be required.
To view usage information for a specific `try-runtime` subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `--help` flag.
For example, to see usage information for `try-runtime on-runtime-upgrade`, you can run the following command:

```shell
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime on-runtime-upgrade --help
```

## Subcommands

You can use the following subcommands with the `try-runtime` command-line tool.
For reference information and examples that illustrate using these subcommands, select an appropriate command.

| Command | Description
| ------- | -----------
| `on-runtime-upgrade` | Executes the migrations of the local runtime.
| `execute-block` | Executes the given block against some state.
| `offchain-worker`| Executes *the offchain worker hooks* of a given block against some state.
| `follow-chain` | Follows the given chain's finalized blocks and applies all of its extrinsics.
| `help`| Displays usage information for try-runtime the specified subcommand.

## Options

You can use the following options with `try-runtime` commands.

| Option | Description
| ------ | -----------
| `--chain <CHAIN_SPEC>` | Specifies the chain specification to use. You can use a predefined chain specification name, such as `dev`, `local`, or `staging` or the path to a file that contains the chain specification, for example, the chain specification generated by using the `build-spec` subcommand.
| `--dev` | Starts the node in development mode in a fresh state. No state is persisted if you run the node using this flag. This option sets `--chain=dev`, `--force-authoring`, `--rpc-cors=all`, `--alice`, and `--tmp` flags, unless explicitly overridden.
| `-d`, `--base-path <path>` | Specifies a custom base path.
| `-l`, `--log <log-pattern>...` | Sets a custom logging filter. The syntax to use is `<log-target>=<level>`, for example `-lsync=debug`. The valid log levels from least to most verbose are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`. By default, all targets log `info` level messages. You can set the global log level with `-l<level>`.
| `--detailed-log-output` | Enables detailed log output, including the log target, log level and thread name. This option is automatically enabled when log level is higher than `info`.
| `--disable-log-color` | Disables log color output.
| `--enable-log-reloading` | Enables feature to dynamically update and reload the log filter. Be aware that enabling this feature can lead to a performance decrease up to factor six or more. Depending on the global logging level the performance decrease changes. The `system_addLogFilter` and `system_resetLogFilter` RPCs will have no effect with this option not being set.
| `--tracing-targets <targets>` | Sets a custom profiling filter. Syntax is the same as for logging: <target>=<level>.
| `--tracing-receiver <receiver>` | Specifies a receiver to process tracing messages.
| `--execution <strategy>` | Determines the execution strategy used by all execution contexts. Valid values are `Native`, `Wasm`, `Both` or `NativeElseWasm`.
| `--wasm-execution <method>` | Specifies the method for executing WebAssembly runtime code. Valid values are `interpreted`, or `compiled`. The default is `Compiled`.
| `--wasm-instantiation-strategy <strategy>` | Specifies the WebAssembly instantiation method to use if `wasm-execution` is set to `compiled`. The default strategy is `pooling-copy-on-write`.
| `--heap-pages <heap_pages>` | Specifies the number of 64KB pages to allocate for WebAssembly execution. The defaults is`sc_service::Configuration.default_heap_pages`.
| `--no-spec-check-panic` | Allows the specification check to issue a warning rather than panic.
| `--state-version <state_version>` | Specifies the state version that is used by the chain. The default is 1.
| `-h, --help` | Displays usage information (use `-h` for a summary).
| `-V, --version` | Displays version information.

## Examples

To use `try-runtime` from the command line, run your node with the `--features=try-runtime` flag.
For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime
```

To view usage information for a specific `try-runtime` subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `--help` flag.
For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime on-runtime-upgrade --help
```

### Setting RPC command-line options

Typically, you use `try-runtime` to prepare for storage migration and runtime upgrades.
However, RPC calls that query storage are computationally expensive.
To prepare a node for testing with `try-runtime`, you should start the node with the following command-line  options:

- `--rpc-max-request-size <RPC_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE>` to set the maximum RPC request payload size—in megabytes—to ensure RPC calls that query storage aren't rejected. The default is 15MiB.

- `--rpc-max-response-size <RPC_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE>` to set the maximum RPC response payload size—in megabytes—to ensure the data retrieved from RPC calls to storage can be returned. The default is 15MiB.

- `--rpc-cors all` to ensure all WebSocket connections can come through.

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release -- \
  --rpc-max-request-size 1000 \
  --rpc-max-response-size 1000 \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --dev
```

### Runtime upgrade

You can use the `on-runtime-upgrade` subcommand to execute against the given runtime state.
For example, you can run `try-runtime` with `on-runtime-upgrade` for a chain running locally with a command like this:

```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime on-runtime-upgrade live ws://localhost:9944
```

### Migration testing

You can combine `try-runtime` with [`fork-off-substrate`](https://github.com/maxsam4/fork-off-substrate) to test your chain before production.
Use `try-runtime` to test your chain's migration and its pre and post states.
Then, use `fork-off-substrate` if you want to check that block production continues after the migration.

### Execute block

The `execute-block` subcommand executes `core_execute_block` using the given block and the runtime state of the parent block.

### Follow chain

The `follow-chain` subcommand follows a given chain's finalized blocks and applies to all its extrinsics. 
This subcommand allows you to inspect the behavior of a new runtime over a long period of time with real transactions coming as input.

### Offchain worker

The `offchain-worker` subcommand executes `offchainWorkerApi_offchain_worker` against the given runtime state.
For example, you can use `try-runtime` to re-execute code from the `ElectionProviderMultiPhase` offchain worker on `localhost:9944` with a command like this:

```bash
cargo run -- --release \
   --features=try-runtime \
   try-runtime \
   --execution Wasm \
   --wasm-execution Compiled \
   offchain-worker \
   --header-at 0x491d09f313c707b5096650d76600f063b09835fd820e2916d3f8b0f5b45bec30 \
   live \
   -b 0x491d09f313c707b5096650d76600f063b09835fd820e2916d3f8b0f5b45bec30 \
   -m ElectionProviderMultiPhase \
   --uri wss://localhost:9944
```

You can run the migrations of the local runtime on the state of SomeChain with a command like this:

```bash
RUST_LOG=runtime=trace,try-runtime::cli=trace,executor=trace \
   cargo run try-runtime \
   --execution Native \
   --chain somechain-dev \
   on-runtime-upgrade \
   live \
   --uri wss://rpc.polkadot.io
```

You can run `try-runtime` against the state for a specific block number with a command like this:

```bash
RUST_LOG=runtime=trace,try-runtime::cli=trace,executor=trace \
   cargo run try-runtime \
   --execution Native \
   --chain dev \
   --no-spec-name-check \
   on-runtime-upgrade \
   live \
   --uri wss://rpc.polkadot.io \
   --at <block-hash>
```

Notice that this command requires the `--no-spec-name-check` command-line option.
