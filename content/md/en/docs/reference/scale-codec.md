title: Type encoding (SCALE)

Substrate uses a lightweight and efficient encoding and decoding program to optimize how data is sent and received over the network.
The program used to serialize and deserialize data is called the SCALE codec, with SCALE being an acronym for <u>s</u>imple <u>c</u>oncatenated <u>a</u>ggregate <u>l</u>ittle-<u>e</u>ndian.

The SCALE codec is a critical component for communication between the runtime and the outer node.

It is designed for high-performance, copy-free encoding and decoding of data in resource-constrained execution environments like the Substrate [WebAssembly runtime](/learn/runtime-development//).

The SCALE codec is not self-describing in any way.
It assumes the decoding context has all type knowledge about the encoded data.
Front-end libraries maintained by Parity use the [`parity-scale-codec`](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec) crate—which is a Rust implementation of the SCALE codec—to encode and decode interactions between RPCs and the runtime.

SCALE codec is advantageous for Substrate and blockchain systems because:

- It is lightweight relative to generic serialization frameworks like [serde](https://serde.rs/), which add significant boilerplate that can bloat the size of the binary.
- It does not use Rust `libstd` making it compatible with `no_std` environments that compile to Wasm, such as the Substrate runtime.
- It is built to have great support in Rust for deriving codec logic for new types using: `#[derive(Encode, Decode)]`.

It's important to define the encoding scheme used in Substrate rather than reuse an existing Rust codec library because this codec needs to be re-implemented on other platforms and languages that want to support interoperability among Substrate blockchains.

The following table shows how the Rust implementation of the Parity SCALE codec encodes different types.

| Structs                       | For structures, the values are named, but that is irrelevant for the encoding (names are ignored - only order matters). All containers store elements consecutively. The order of the elements is not fixed, depends on the container, and cannot be relied on at decoding. This implicitly means that decoding some byte-array into a specified structure that enforces an order and then re-encoding it could result in a different byte array than the original that was decoded. | A `SortedVecAsc<u8>` structure that always has byte-elements in ascending order: `SortedVecAsc::from([3, 5, 2, 8])` | `[3, 2, 5, 8]`                       |
| Enumerations (tagged-unions)  | A fixed number of variants, each mutually exclusive and potentially implying a further value or series of values.

Thus, no more than 256 variants are supported.                                                                                                                                                           | `Int(42)` and `Bool(true)` where `enum IntOrBool { Int(u8), Bool(bool),}`                                           | `0x002a` and `0x0101`                |

[^1]: Compact/general integers are encoded with the two least significant bits denoting the mode:

    - `0b00`: single-byte mode; upper six bits are the LE encoding of the value (valid only for values
      of 0-63).
    - `0b01`: two-byte mode: upper six bits and the following byte is the LE encoding of the value
      (valid only for values `64-(2**14-1)`).
    - `0b10`: four-byte mode: upper six bits and the following three bytes are the LE encoding of the
      value (valid only for values `(2**14)-(2**30-1)`).
    - `0b11`: Big-integer mode: The upper six bits are the number of bytes following, plus four. The
      value is contained, LE encoded, in the bytes following. The final (most significant) byte must be
      non-zero. Valid only for values `(2**30)-(2**536-1)`.

[^2]: Results are encoded as:

    - `0x00` if the operation was successful, followed by the encoded value.
    - `0x01` if the operation was unsuccessful, followed by the encoded error.
