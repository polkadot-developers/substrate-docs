The FRAME development environment provides modules—called pallets—and support libraries that you can use, modify, and extend to build the runtime logic to suit the needs of your blockchain.

This section provides an overview of the predefined pallets and links to the Rust API reference documentation, where you can find details about each pallet's interfaces.

## System pallets

The FRAME system pallets are integral to the Substrate runtime and provide core functionality that all other pallets depend on.

## Functional pallets

The Substrate development framework includes many functional pallets that provide features you might find generally useful as composable components of your blockchain.
These functional pallets are prebuilt and freely available to enable the community to share, reuse, and improve the interfaces to address common use cases.

The following table highlights some of the most commonly used pallets available.
However, the number of pallets that provide specialized functionality and how they provide that functionality changes frequently.
You should check the [Rust documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/) for the most up-to-date listing of pallets and for details about using them.

## Parachain pallets

In addition to the functional pallets that are generally useful for any blockchain, there are prebuilt pallets that provide features specifically for blockchains that are intended to connect to a relay chain.
The following pallets provide features for parachain development.
