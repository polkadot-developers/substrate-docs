The **Develop smart contracts** tutorials guide you through how you can use the ink programming language to build smart contracts that run on a Substrate-based blockchain.
The tutorials in this section use a preconfigured `contracts-node` and a hosted [Contracts UI](https://paritytech.github.io/contracts-ui).
If you want to use the standard node template, you need to add the Contracts pallet and a few other components to your development environment.
Preparing the node template for building smart contracts is covered in []().

- [Prepare your first contract](/tutorials/smart-contracts/develop-contract/) describes how to update your development environment and create a smart contract project using the ink! programming language.
- [Develop a smart contract](/tutorials/smart-contracts/first-smart-contract/) demonstrates how to store, increment, and retrieve simple values using a smart contract.
- [Use maps for storing values](/tutorials/smart-contracts/use-mapping/) extends the previous tutorial by illustrating how to use maps to store and retrieve values in a smart contract.
- [Build a token contract](/tutorials/smart-contracts/erc20-token/) illustrates how you can build a simple smart contract for transferring ERC-20 tokens.
- [Troubleshoot smart contracts](/tutorials/smart-contracts/sc-common-issues/) describes a few common issues that you might encounter when writing and deploying smart contracts.
