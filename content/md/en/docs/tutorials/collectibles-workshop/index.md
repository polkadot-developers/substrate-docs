The Substrate Developer Hub provides self-paced workshops with content and coding challenges to help you learn about building blockchains and decentralized applications using Substrate, Rust, and related tools.

As you progress through the workshops, you’ll learn basic concepts, see examples of what to do, and test your knowledge by converting what you’ve learned into working code.
No coding experience is required (but it doesn’t hurt to have some).

Workshops assume that you are familiar with a few basic Substrate concepts and terms.
If you aren’t quite ready to try the workshops, explore the simpler hands-on [Get started](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/get-started/) tutorials for a more guided introduction to developing with Substrate.

## Roadmap

Depending on your interests and ambitions, you might want to follow different pathways through the tutorials, workshops, and other documentation.
The roadmap suggests some alternatives for the journey based on where you are and where you're going.
Find the path that fits your passion.

Note that currently only the first part of the _Runtime and pallets_ workshop is available here.
Plans for part two—covering the basics of front-end development for the collectibles application—are underway.
Part three of the _Runtime and pallets_ workshop is will introduce the benefits and strategy for moving a solo chain application to a parachain test environment.

Future workshops are planned to cover smart contract development and the parachain development and deployment lifecycle.
