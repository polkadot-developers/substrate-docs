If you completed the checklist in [Prepare a working environment](/tutorials/collectibles-workshop/01-prepare/), you have successfully compiled a Substrate node.
This particular node‚Äîthe substrate-node-template‚Äîis preconfigured with a few common modules to provide a simple working environment to get you started.

## About the node template

The node template includes some default blockchain essentials, like peer-to-peer networking, block authoring, consensus, and block import for finalized blocks.
The node template also includes some basic functionality for working with accounts and transactions and performing administrative actions.
This core set of functionality is provided through several predefined modules‚Äîcalled pallets‚Äîthat implement specific features.

The following core modules are predefined in the node template:

- `pallet_balances` for managing account assets and transfers between accounts.
- `pallet_transaction_payment` for managing transaction fees for the transactions performed.
- `pallet_sudo` for performing operations that require administrative permissions.

The node template also provides a starter `pallet_template` that illustrates how to implement features in custom pallets.
A lot of what you'll be doing in this workshop is similar to what you see in the `pallet_template` except that you'll implement logic that's specific to the application you're building.

## Rename your workspace

To differentiate between the default Substrate node template and the workspace you'll be using to customize the node, you can rename the working directory and create a separate branch for your changes.

To prepare a custom workspace:

1. Open a terminal on your local computer and navigate to the directory that contains the `substrate-node-template` root directory.

2. Rename the `substrate-node-template` root directory by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   mv substrate-node-template workshop-node-template
   ```

   In subsequent steps, the `workshop-node-template` directory is used to refer to the root directory for the node.

1. Change to the root directory for the node by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   cd workshop-node-template
   ```

1. Create a custom branch for your workspace by running a command similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   git switch -c build-substrate-workshop
   ```

   Because you're only changing the name of your workspace folder and repository branch, you don't have to recompile the node.
   If you want to verify the build by recompiling, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Start the node in development mode

After you've renamed your workspace, you can start your node in development mode and let it run in the background.
In development mode, the node uses some default settings that are predefined for a development environment. 
A few of the default settings for the development environment include:

- Several predefined accounts, including Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave.
- Initial account balances for the Alice and Bob accounts.
- Root-level permissions for the Alice account.
- Predefined authority to produce and validate blocks using the Alice account.
  
By default, development mode also stores chain data in a temporary database and deletes that data when you stop the node. 

To start the local Substrate node:

1. Open a terminal shell, if needed.

2. Change to the `workshop-node-template` root directory.

3. Start the node in development mode by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   ./target/release/node-template --dev
   ```
   
   In development mode, the chain doesn't require any peer computers to finalize blocks. 
   After some initialization messages, you should see that blocks are being proposed, sealed,  and finalized.
   For example:

   You now have a running blockchain that's producing blocks.
   You can leave it running in the background or stop and restart it whenever you like.
   
   - To stop the node, press Control-c.
   - To restart the node, run `./target/release/node-template --dev`.

   The next step is to start customizing what this blockchain does.
