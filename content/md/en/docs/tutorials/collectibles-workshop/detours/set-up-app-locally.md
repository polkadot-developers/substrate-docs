The [Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) is a hosted Polkadot-JS API application that enables you to interact with Polkadot and Substrate-based chains without installing a user interface framework or building your own user interface components.
You can access the portal directly to submit transactions and test functions from your local development environment.

With the hosted application, you simply select the network and endpoint that you want to connect to.
For example, if you are running a node locally and using the default port for WebSocket connections, you can select the Development chain and Local node.

Alternatively, you can install the Polkadot-JS API in your local development environment and use the API to build your own JavaScript or TypeScript applications for your blockchain.
