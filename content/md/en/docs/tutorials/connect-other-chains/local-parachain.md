In this tutorial, you'll connect a parachain to a local relay chain.

## Tutorial objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will accomplish the following objectives:

- Register a `ParaID` for your parachain on a relay chain.
- Start block production of a parachain on a relay chain.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

- You have competed the [Prepare a local parachain testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/local-relay/) tutorial, and have a running local network with no les than two validators.
- You have the specific software versions defined in the [Prepare a local parachain testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/local-relay/#matching-versions-are-critical) incorporated into your parachain.
  For example, if you are using [Polkadot `release-v0.9.26`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/release-v0.9.26), use the `polkadot-v0.9.26` version of the [parachain template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/tree/polkadot-v0.9.26).

## Build the parachain template

This tutorial uses the [Substrate parachain template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template) to launch a parachain on your local relay chain.
The parachain template is similar to the [node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) used in solo chain development, so it should be quite familiar.
Later, you'll use this parachain template as the starting point for developing your own parachains.

In a new terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the parachain template with the correct Polkadot version
git clone --depth 1 --branch polkadot-v0.9.26 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the parachain template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo b -r
```

Compiling the node can take 15 to 60 minuets.
In the mean time, [reserve a `ParaID`](#reserve-a-para-id) on the running relay chain to prepare, and make not of the `ParaID` you acquire.

## Reserve a ParaID

To connect to any relay chain, you must first reserve a `ParaID` for your parachain.
It is called a `ParaID` because the same identifier can be used as a parachain ID or a parathread ID, depending on your current relay chain slot state.
You must have a sufficient funds to reserve a ParaID.
Refer to your target relay chain to determine the number of tokens required.

The relay chain is responsible for allotting all `ParaID`s and simply increments starting at `2000` for all chains that are not [common good parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-common-goods).
These chains use a different method to allocate `ParaID`s.

This exercise illustrates how to reserve a `ParaID` using [Polkadot-JS Apps connecting to your local relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/parachains/parathreads).
Under the **Network** > **Parachains** sub-page, click on **Parathreads** tab and use the **+ ParaId** button.

![Reserve a `ParaID`](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/paraid-reserve.png)

Note that the account used to reserve the `ParaID` must also be the origin for using this `ParaID`.
After you submit this transaction and see a successful `registrar.Reserved` event with your `paraID`), you can launch your parachain or parathread using the reserved ID.
You are now ready to generate the files required for your parachain using the reserved `ParaID` (`ParaID` `2000`).

## Custom parachain specification

Your chain specification _must_ set the correct reserved `ParaID` for your parachain.

See the [how-to guide on configuring a custom chain spec](/reference/how-to-guides/basics/customize-a-chain-specification/) for more in-depth instructions to generate a plain spec, modify it, and generate a raw spec.

We first generate a plain spec with:

```bash
# Assumes that `rococo-local` is in `node/chan_spec.rs` as the relay you registered with
./target/release/parachain-collator build-spec --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-local-parachain-plain.json
```

Default `ParaID` is `1000` from Cumulus, so you must correctly set it for your parachain based on **the reserved `ParaID` from above**.
Assuming your reserved `ParaID` is `2000`, you will open `rococo-local-parachain-plain.json` and modify two fields:

```json
  // --snip--
  "para_id": 2000, // <--- your already registered ID
  // --snip--
      "parachainInfo": {
        "parachainId": 2000 // <--- your already registered ID
      },
  // --snip--
```

Then generate a raw chain spec derived **from your modified plain chain spec**:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator build-spec --chain rococo-local-parachain-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-local-parachain-2000-raw.json
```

### Save and distribute your raw spec

You must have a sufficient funds to reserve a ParaID.
Refer to your target relay chain to determine the number of tokens required.

The relay chain is responsible for allotting all `ParaID`s and simply increments starting at `2000` for all chains that are not [common good parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-common-goods).
These chains use a different method to allocate `ParaID`s.

This exercise illustrates how to reserve a `ParaID` using [Polkadot-JS Apps connecting to your local relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/parachains/parathreads).
Under the **Network** > **Parachains** sub-page, click on **Parathreads** tab and use the **+ ParaId** button.

![Reserve a `ParaID`](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/paraid-reserve.png)

Note that the account used to reserve the `ParaID` must also be the origin for using this `ParaID`.
After you submit this transaction and see a successful `registrar.Reserved` event with your `paraID`), you can launch your parachain or parathread using the reserved ID.

### Obtain Wasm runtime validation function

The relay chain also needs the parachain-specific runtime validation logic to validate parachain blocks.
The parachain collator node also has a command to produce this Wasm blob:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-wasm --chain rococo-local-parachain-2000-raw.json > para-2000-wasm
```

### Generate a parachain genesis state

To register a parachain, the relay chain needs to know the parachain's genesis state.
The collator node can export that state to a file.
Go to your Parachain Template folder, the following command will create a file containing the parachain's entire genesis state, hex-encoded:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-state --chain rococo-local-parachain-2000-raw.json > para-2000-genesis
```

**No pre-genesis blocks allowed**

This runtime and state is for the parachain's _genesis_ block only.
You can't connect a parachain with any previous state to a relay chain. All parachains must start from block 0 on the relay chain.
Eventually, migrating the block history of a solo chain built on Substrate is expected to be possible, but this functionality is not planned anytime soon.

See the guide on [converting a solo chain to a parachain](/reference/how-to-guides/parachains/convert-a-solo-chain/) for details on how the parachain template was created and how to convert your chain's logic‚Äînot its history or state migrations‚Äîto a parachain.

## Start a collator node

We can now start a single collator node.
Notice that we need to supply the same relay chain chain spec we used for launching relay chain nodes at the second half of the command.
Start a collator with the following command:

```bash
./target/release/parachain-collator \
--alice \
--collator \
--force-authoring \
--chain rococo-local-parachain-2000-raw.json \
--base-path /tmp/parachain/alice \
--port 40333 \
--ws-port 8844 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain <relay chain raw chain spec> \
--port 30343 \
--ws-port 9977
```

The first thing to notice about this command is that several arguments are passed before the lone `--`, and several more arguments passed after it.
A parachain collator contains the actual collator node and also an **embedded relay chain node**. The arguments before the `--` are for the collator, and the arguments after the `--` are for the embedded relay chain node.

We give the collator a base path and ports as we did for the relay chain node previously.

Remember to change the collator-specific values if you are executing these instructions a second time for a second parachain.
You must use the same relay chain specification file, but different `ParaID`, base path, and port numbers for the second parachain collator to bind to.

There is presently no way to run a parachain node without the embedded relay chain node, but it is expected that this will become possible for non-collator nodes eventually.

At this point your _collator's logs_ should look something like this:

You should see your collator node running as a standalone node and its relay node connecting as a peer with the already running relay chain validator nodes.

Note if you do not see the embedded relay chain peering with local relay chain node, try disabling your firewall or adding the `bootnodes` parameter with the relay node's address.

It has not started authoring parachain blocks yet.
Authoring will begin when the collator is actually **registered on the relay chain**.

## Parachain Registration

There are a few methods possible to register a parachain to a relay chain.
For testing, use of `sudo` is most common.

### Register Using `sudo`

We have our relay chain launched and our parachain collator ready to go.
Now we have to register the parachain on the relay chain.
In a production network, this will typically be accomplished through [parachain auctions](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction).
But for this tutorial we will do it with `sudo` call.

### Registration Transaction

The transaction can be submitted **on a relay chain node** via Polkadot-JS Apps UI.
There are multiple options to go about this, and we can pick any one of the following.
Note that all options here depend on a [`paraID` being reserved](#reserve-a-para-id) - so be sure to do that first.

If you are running a network with more than two validators you can add more parachains through the same interface with the parameters adjusted accordingly.

#### Option 1: `paraSudoWrapper.sudoScheduleParaInitialize`

This option bypasses the slot lease mechanics entirely to onboard a parachain or parathread for a reserved `paraID` starting on the next relay chain session.
This is the simplest and fastest way to go about testing.
But note that the parachain will These required files to register a parachain include details set in your chain specifications that must explicitly target the correct relay chain and use the right `ParaID` - in this case, `rococo` (instead of `rococo-local` used in this tutorial).

- Go to [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/), connecting to your **relay chain**.
- Execute a sudo extrinsic on the relay chain by going to `Developer` -> `sudo` page.
- Pick `paraSudoWrapper` -> `sudoScheduleParaInitialize(id, genesis)` as the extrinsic type, shown below.

![parachain-registration-sudo.png](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/parachain-registration-sudo.png)

- In the extrinsics parameters, specify:
  - Set the `id: ParaId` to 2,000
  - `genesisHead`: upload the file `para-2000-genesis` (from the previous step)
  - `validationCode`: upload the file `para-2000-wasm` (from the previous step)
  - Set the `parachain: Bool` option to **Yes**

This dispatch, if successful, will emit the `sudo.Sudid` event, viewable in the relay chain explorer page.

#### Option 2: `slots.forceLease`

This is the more formal flow for registration used in production (with the exception of the use of sudo to force a slot lease): you register your reserved `paraID` with the _same_ account that reserved it, or use `sudo` with a `registrar.forceRegister` extrinsic if you wish.

Here we will use `sudo` to grant ourselves a lease.
You should have an onboarded parathread:

![parathread-onboarding.png](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/parathread-onboarding.png)

- Go to [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/), connecting to your **relay chain**.
- Execute a sudo extrinsic on the relay chain by going to `Developer` -> `sudo` page.
- Pick `slots`->`forceLease(para, leaser, amount, period_begin, period_end)` as the extrinsic type, shown below.

![forceLease.png](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/forceLease.png)

Be sure to set the begin period to the slot you wish to start at.
In testing, this is very likely to be the already active slot `0` if you started a fresh new relay chain.
Extending this out to beyond the time you wish to test this parachain is likely the best, unless you want to test the
onboarding and offboarding cycles.
In that case, then electing slot leases that have gaps for a `paraID` would be in order. Once fully onboarded and after block production starts you should see:

![parachain-active-lease.png](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/parachain-active-lease.png)

### Block production

The collator should start producing parachain blocks (aka collating) once the registration is successful **and the next relay chain epoch begin**!

> This may take a while!
> Be patient as you wait for the next epoch to start.
> This is 10 blocks for the example [`rococo-custom-2-raw.json`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-docs/blob/main/static/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chain-specs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json) included in the [Prepare a local parachain testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/local-relay/) tutorial.

Finally, the collator should start producing log messages like the following:

```bash
# Notice the relay epoch change! Only then do we start parachain collating!

### Block finalization

The relay chain tracks the latest block (the head) of each parachain.
When a relay chain block is finalized, every parachain blocks that have completed the [validation process](https://polkadot.network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block) are also finalized.
This is how Polkadot achieves **pooled, shared security** for it's parachains!

You can see the registered parachains and their latest data by clicking **Network** > **Parachains** in the Apps UI.

![parachain-summary-screenshot.png](/media/images/docs/tutorials/09-cumulus/parachain-summary-screenshot.png)

## Interact with your parachain

The entire point of launching and registering parachains is that we can submit transactions to the parachains and interact with them.
We are finally ready to submit extrinsics on our parachains!

### Connecting with the Apps UI

We've already connected the Apps UI to the relay chain node.
Now we can also connect to the parachain collator.
Open another instance of Apps UI in a new browser window, and connect it to the appropriate endpoint.
If you have followed this tutorial so far, you can connect to the parachain node at:

https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8844#/

### Submit extrinsics

You can make some simple token transfers to ensure that the parachain is operating normally.
You can also make some on-chain remarks by going to the `Extrinsics` page, choosing `System` pallet and `remark` extrinsic.

If the transaction go through as expected, you have a working parachain.

**_Congratulations!_**

Read on for more optional material.

#### Cross-chain Message Passing (XCMP)

The defining feature of connecting parachains to a _common_ relay chain is the ability to communicate _between_ all connected chains.
This area of functionality is at the cutting edge development and is not included in this tutorial.

To learn more about XCMP, refer to [Polkadot wiki on XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain).

<!-- TODO NAV.YML -->
<!-- add info on and link to /tutorials/connect-other-chains/xcm/ page implemented and referenced here-->

## Chain purging

Your sole collator is the **only home of the parachain blockchain data** as there is only one node on your entire parachain network.
Relay chains only store parachains header information.
**If the parachain data is lost, you will not be able to recover the chain.**
In testing though, you may need to start things from scratch.

To purge your parachain chain data from the relay chain, you need to deregister and re-register the parachain collator.
It may be easier in testing to instead just purge the relay and parachains and start again form genesis.
You can purge all chain data for all chains by running the following commands:

```bash
# Purge the collator(s)
./target/release/parachain-collator purge-chain \
  --base-path <your collator DB path set above>

# Purge the validator(s)
polkadot purge-chain \
  --base-path <your relay chain DB path set above>
```

Then register from a blank slate again.

## Next steps

- Learn more about collators on the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator).
- [Add more parachain nodes](/reference/how-to-guides/parachains/add-paranodes/) to your parachain network.
- Very rigorously [Test](/main-docs/test/) your local parachain network.
- Connect your parachain to rococo by getting a [Rococo testnet slot](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/rococo-slot/).
- See the guide on [converting a solo chain to a parachain](/reference/how-to-guides/parachains/convert-a-solo-chain/) to convert your chain's logic-not state or running-chain migrations-to a parachain.
