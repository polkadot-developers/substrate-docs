The **Connect other chains** tutorials delve into more advanced topics for moving beyond solo chain development, including how to connect your chain to other chains.

## Tutorials under construction

- [Start a local relay chain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/relay-chain/) helps you prepare a local relay chain as a first step for converting a solo chain into a parachain.
- [Connect to a local relay chain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/parachain/) highlights the steps necessary to connect your local parachain to a relay chain.

<!-- - [Deploy a parachain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/deploy-parachain/) introduces the steps for connecting your parachain to a public test network.
- [Connect to Rococo testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/connect-rococo/) summarizes the specific steps for connecting a parachain to the Rococo test network.
- [Connect to Ethereum](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/connect-to-evm/) illustrates how to build an Ethereum-compatible blockchain project. -->
