The **Connect other chains** tutorials delve into more advanced topics for moving beyond solo chain development, including how to connect your chain to other chains.

## Tutorials under construction

- [Prepare a local parachain testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/local-relay/) helps you prepare a local relay chain as a first step for converting a solo chain into a parachain.
- [Connect a local parachain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/local-parachain/) highlights the steps necessary to connect your local parachain to a relay chain.
- [Connect to Rococo testnet](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/rococo-slot/) summarizes the steps for connecting a parachain to the Rococo test network.
