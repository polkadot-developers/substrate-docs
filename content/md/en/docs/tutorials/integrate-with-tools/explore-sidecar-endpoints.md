The Substrate [sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) service provides a REST API for interacting with blockchain nodes built using the Substrate FRAME framework. 
The sidecar REST service exposes an extensive set of endpoints that enable you to interact with nodes, accounts, transactions, parachains, and many other components of a Substrate-based blockchain.

For this tutorial, you'll use Postman to explore the `sidecar` service.
Postman is a popular platform for inspecting, building, and testing application programming interfaces. 
Postman provides an easy-to-use interface that enables both new amd experienced API developers to collaborate and experiment using either a browser-based or desktop client. 

In this tutorial, you'll use a [predefined API collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24602305/2s8YsqWaj8#intro) to explore the features `sidecar` provides through RESTful endpoints.
The predefined API collection provides a set of saved requests created using Postman that you can customize and reuse. 
By using API collections that are created with Postman, you have access to features such as inline documentation, reusable variables to access data, error detection in parameter formation, and more.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

- You have configured your environment for Substrate development by installing [Rust and the Rust toolchain](/install/).
- You have access to at least one Substrate node with the node template installed and running locally.
- You have Node.js, version 14 or later, available on your local computer to download and install the `sidecar` package.
- You have, or can create, a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) account.
- You have access to, or can install, the **Postman for Web** or **Postman for Mac** client.
  
## Tutorial objectives

By completing this tutorial, you'll learn how to explore the `sidecar` API REST service using Postman, including how to:

- Download and install the `sidecar` service.
- Import a Postman API collection.
- Set up a working environment.
- Make API requests to the `sidecar` API.
- Save the data for further use.

## Download and install sidecar

To download and install `sidecar`:

1. Open a terminal shell.
2. Install the `@substrate/api-sidecar` service globally or locally using `npm` or `yarn`.
   
   For example, if you use `yarn`, run the following command for global installation of the `@substrate/api-sidecar` service:
   
   ```bash
   yarn global add @substrate/api-sidecar
   ```
   
   If you use `npm` as your package manager, run the following command for global installation of the `@substrate/api-sidecar` service:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g @substrate/api-sidecar
   ```

1. Verify you have a Substrate node running for the service to connect to.
   
   By default, the service attempts to connect to the local host using ws://127.0.0.1:9944. 
   You can configure the service to use a different URL by modifying the SAS_SUBSTRATE_URL environment setting.
   If you want to connect to the node template running locally using the default port, not configuration is necessary.

2. Start the service by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   substrate-api-sidecar
   ```

   If you are using the default configuration, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```text
   SAS:
     ðŸ“¦ LOG:
        âœ… LEVEL: "info"
        âœ… JSON: false

   ```

## Import the API collection

To use the predefined API collection for `sidecar`:

1. Open the predefined [Substrate API Sidecar](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24602305/2s8YsqWaj8#intro) API collection in a browser.
2. Click **Run in Postman** in the top-right corner of the page. 
3. Select to run the collection either using Postman for Web or in the Postman for Mac desktop client.
   
   In you are using a macOS computer, you should run the collection with the desktop client because the desktop client is generally more stable and supports more features.
   If you don't have Postman for Mac installed on your local computer, click **Get the app** to download it.
   
   ![Run the API collection in Postman](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/run-in-postman.png)
   
1. Select a workspace in Postman, then click **Import** to add the predefined collection to your Postman workspace/

   After you open the Substrate API `sidecar` collection in Postman, you are ready to start defining your environment variables.

## Define environment variables

The predefined Postman API Collection comes with a built-in development environment named `Dev`. 
This environment includes the predefined variables for you to use in the different API requests to the `sidecar` service using the predefined queries. 
The variables defined in the `Dev` environment include the following:

- `url` to specify the URL for your `sidecar` REST API to use. 
  The default value is `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `account` to specify the account identifier of a specific user on the blockchain.
- `number` to specify the number of a specific block from the blockchain.
- `extrensicIndex` to specify the index number of a specific extrinsic in a block.
- `assetId` to specify the identifier of a pallet asset.
- `storageItemId` to specify the identifier of a pallet storage item.
- `paraId` to specify the unique numeric identifier for a specific parachain.

All requests require the `url` variable. 
The `Dev` environment provides  `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as the default value for the url because that URL is the default REST API address created when you start a new instance of the `sidecar` service. 
If you have set the `sidecar` service to use an external hosting location or changed the default local URL using an environment setting, you must change the default value for the `url` variable accordingly.
In addition to the `url` variable, different types of requests require you to define different variables. 

For example, in this tutorial, the query to return the balance of a specific account on the blockchain requires you to define a value for the `account` variable.

## Get a list of endpoints

You can use Postman to send a `GET` request to `sidecar` to return a list of all the active endpoints available for the API collection. 
This request requires only the `url` variable to be defined.
In most cases, you can use the default value for the local host IP address and port unless you are using `sidecar` outside of the local development environment.

To get a list of endpoints:

1. In the Postman client, click **Collections** and open the **Substrate API Sidecar** collection.
2. From the list, select the **GET List of API Endpoints** request.
   
   ![Select the GET Endpoints request](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/select-get-endpoints.png)
   
   After you select the **Get the List of API Endpoints** request, Postman displays the options available for this request. 
   Because this request only requires the URL and doesn't use any other parameters, there are no settings to configure here. 
   
   ![Set parameters for the request](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/endpoint-parameters.png)

   If a request takes additional parameters, you can experiment by providing different values for the parameters and seeing how those values provide different responses from the API.

3. Specify the URL to connect to using the predefined `url` variable by typing `{{url}}`.

   ![Specify the URL for the request](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/specify-url.png)

4. Click **Send**.

   After you send the request, you should see the response section in Postman populated with data. 
   By default, the data is displayed in JSON format, but you can change response to XML, HTML, or plain text. 
   You should see information similar to the following partial response:
   
   ```json
   {
     "docs": "https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist",
     "github": "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar",
     "version": "14.2.2",
     "listen": "127.0.0.1:8080",
     "routes": [
        {
            "path": "/accounts/:address/asset-balances",
            "method": "get"
        },
        {
            "path": "/accounts/:address/asset-approvals",
            "method": "get"
        },
      ]
   } 
   ```

5. Click **Save response** to save this response to an output file if you want to use it to build features for your own applications.
   
   You can also save the response as a example for future reference.
   If you save the response as an example, it is added underneath the GET List of API Endpoints request option. 
   
   This list of endpoints request is a useful demonstration of a simple request.
   However, more often, you'll want to use sidecar endpoints to access specific data that will require you to manipulate the values defined for different variable to retrieve the specific information you want. 
   
   That's the next step in this tutorial.

## Get account information

Now that you are familiar with making an uncomplicated request, let's perform another `GET` request but this time modifying the value of one of the environment variables.
In this request, you'll request the balance for a specific account on the chain. 
Using the [substrate node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) as the working blockchain, this request queries the account balance of the `Alice` user. 
To get the account address for `Alice`, you can connect to the running node using the [Substrate front-end template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) or use the `node-template key inspect` command.

To get account information:

1. Open a new terminal shell.
2. Copy the account address for Alice.
   
   For example, inspect key information for the `//Alice` account by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/node-template key inspect //Alice
   ```

   Copy the public key for the account:

   ```

   ```

3. In the Postman client, select the **Dev** environment to display the list of environment variables and their values.
   
   For each variable, there's an initial value and a current value. 
   
   - The `initial value` is what the variable is loaded with when starting a fresh `Dev` environment.
   - The `current value` is the value for the current session. 
   
   The `current value` is only saved locally and never sent to Postman or shared with other team members using the same Postman API collection.

1. Paste the account address for `Alice` into the `current value` field. 

   ![Account variable in Postman environment](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/dev-variables.png)
   
1. Click **Collections** and open the **Substrate API Sidecar** collection. 

1. Select the **Accounts** folder, then select **GET Account Balance Info**.
   
   ![Select the Account Balance Info request](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/account-balance.png)
   
2. Configure the request using the `url` variable that you used previously and the `account` variable you set in Step 4:
   
   ![Specify the endpoint for the request](/media/images/docs/tutorials/postman-sidecar/account-request.png)

   
3. Click **Send**.
   
   You should receive a response that looks similar to the following in JSON format:
   
   ```json
   {
     "at": {
        "hash": "0xfc354903a665c7847ba4f83dd9e5fb0389e31bc2015086aca56a68bb345493a5",
        "height": "1189"
     },
     "nonce": "0",
     "tokenSymbol": "UNIT",
     "free": "1152921504606846976",
     "reserved": "0",
     "miscFrozen": "0",
     "feeFrozen": "0",
     "locks": []
   }
   ```
   
  You can save this response as a file or as an example within Postman to assist you in creating tests or building your own applications.

## What's next?

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

- Import an API collection into Postman.
- Define environment variables to use in a collection.
- Send API requests with custom variable definitions.
- Inspect and save the responses from the API. 

You now have a good working basis for using `sidecar` endpoints within Postman and to begin building applications that use the `sidecar` API for your own purpose. 
To explore more on your own, consider the following tasks:

- Send requests using the other endpoints in the predefined collection.
- Write tests in Postman for debugging purposes.
- Set up Postman flows that allow you to connect a series of API REST requests.
