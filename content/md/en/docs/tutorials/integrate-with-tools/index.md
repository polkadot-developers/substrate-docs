The **Integrate with tools** tutorials highlight tools and node extensions that enable you to deploy nodes that can integrate with other systems and how to use additional ecosystem tools that allow you to access, synchronize, and interact with information your own or other blockchains.

- [Integrate a light client node](/tutorials/integrate-with-tools/integrate-a-light-client-node/) describes how you can use the Substrate Connect light client node to synchronize and interact with a Substrate chain from a browser.
- [Explore sidecar endpoints](/tutorials/integrate-with-tools/explore-sidecar-endpoints/) demonstrates how you can interact with a Substrate-based chain using the sidecar RESTful API and endpoints.
- [Access EVM accounts](/tutorials/integrate-with-tools/access-evm-accounts/) illustrates how you can use a customized Substrate node to access to Ethereum-based accounts and contracts.
