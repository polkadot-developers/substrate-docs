The **Build a parachain** tutorials delve into more advanced topics for moving beyond solo chain development, including how to connect your chain to other chains.

- [Prepare a local relay chain](/tutorials/build-a-parachain/prepare-a-local-relay-chain/) helps you prepare a local relay chain to use in testing a local parachain.
- [Connect a local parachain](/tutorials/build-a-parachain/connect-a-local-parachain/) highlights the steps necessary to connect your local parachain to a relay chain.
- [Acquire a testnet slot](/tutorials/build-a-parachain/acquire-a-testnet-slot/) summarizes the steps for connecting a parachain to the Rococo test network.
- [Open message passing channels](/tutorials/build-a-parachain/open-message-passing-channels/) demonstrates how to construct cross-consensus messages to open channels that allow parachains to communicate with each other.
- [Transfer assets with XCM](/tutorials/build-a-parachain/transfer-assets-with-xcm/) illustrates how to use cross-consensus messages to execute a remote transfer to a parachain through the relay chain.
