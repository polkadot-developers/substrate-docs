WIP

<!-- TODO NAV.YAML -->
<!-- content/md/en/docs/tutorials/build-a-parachain/parachain.md in next steps once in nav -->

<!-- TODO

Outline:
- VMP with single collator configured and executed
  - relay local and parachain tutos completed, assume single parachain on relay chain
- Add Rocmine to the local relaychain
  - [HRMP](/reference/how-to-guides/parachains/add-hrmp-channels/) updated for this purpose and referenced.
  - [Add parachain nodes](/reference/how-to-guides/parachains/add-paranodes/) used if needed to add relay validators and additional collators.
  - New guide for various ways to get a slot for testing and for production? TODO
