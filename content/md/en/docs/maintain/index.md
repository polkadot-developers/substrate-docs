In many ways, deploying your project as a parachain, parathread, paraobject, or private solo chain is the beginning of your journey.
To keep your application viable and evolving, it's important to build your community and manage your network, including staying up-to-date with hardware and software upgrades, managing new releases, and maintaining your infrastructure.
The topics in this section are intended to highlight—in a generalized form—some of the most important maintenance tasks.
However, every project is different and most projects will require their own specialized set of instructions, processes, and policies. 

- [Monitor](/maintain/monitor/) describes the default telemetry available for Substrate nodes and the Polkadot ecosystem, including how to view and filter the information available.
- [Runtime upgrades](/maintain/runtime-upgrades/) explains how runtime versioning and storage migration support runtime upgrades, enabling your blockchain to evolve over time.

The following topics are planned but not available at this time:

- [Operate](/maintain/operate/)
- [Client upgrades](/maintain/client-upgrades/)
- [Network upgrades](/maintain/network-upgrades/)
- [Storage migration](/maintain/storage-migration/)
