The telemetry components in the Substrate outer node provide low-level information about the operation of the network. 
The information exposed can be sent to a backend telemetry server where it can be collected into a data series for display in a front-end dashboard or charts and graphs. 

Substrate telemetry relies on the tracing library from the Tokio Rust crate to log and transmit information about node operations.
The `tokio` tracing layer sends the information it collects through an asynchronous channel to a background task called `TelemetryWorker`.
The `TelemetryWorker` forwards the information to one or more remote telemetry servers.
You can use the `--telemetry-url` command-line option when you start a node to specify to specify the telemetry server that you want to send telemetry data to.


impl Telemetry
source
pub fn start_telemetry(
    &mut self,
    connection_message: ConnectionMessage
) -> Result<()>
Initialize the telemetry with the endpoints provided in argument for the current substrate node.

This method must be called during the substrate node initialization.

The endpoints argument is a collection of telemetry WebSocket servers with a corresponding verbosity level.

The connection_message argument is a JSON object that is sent every time the connection (re-)establishes.

source
pub fn handle(&self) -> TelemetryHandle
Make a new cloneable handle to this Telemetry. This is used for reporting telemetries.

ConnectionMessage

name: String
Node’s name.

implementation: String
Node’s implementation.

version: String
Node’s version.

config: String
Node’s configuration.

chain: String
Node’s chain.

genesis_hash: String
Node’s genesis hash.

authority: bool
Node is an authority.

startup_time: String
Node’s startup time.

network_id: String
Node’s network ID.

target_os: String
Node’s OS.

target_arch: String
Node’s ISA.

target_env: String
Node’s target platform ABI or libc.

sysinfo: Option<SysInfo>
Node’s software and hardware information.

The telemetry information includes details about the hardware and software running on the node, including:

- The exact CPU model.

- The total amount of memory, in bytes.

- The number of physical CPU cores.

- The Linux kernel version.

- The exact Linux distribution used.

- Whether the node’s running under a virtual machine.


If multiple Substrate nodes are running in the same process, the `TelemetryWorker` uses a tracing::Span trait to identify which Substrate node is reporting the data. 
Every task spawned using sc-service’s TaskManager automatically inherits this span.

By default, when you start a Substrate node, the node initializes a [Telemetry](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_telemetry/struct.Telemetry.html) data structure instance that can be used to send telemetry messages.
The `Telemetry` instance connects to the remote endpoints the node should send data to and sets up a `TelemetryWorker` thread to run in the background. 
The `TelemetryWorker` registers a new `TelemetryWorkerHandle` to use for asynchronous communication ng with the running TelemetryWorker dedicated to registration. 
Registering can happen at any point in time during the process execution.
