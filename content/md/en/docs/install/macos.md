You can install Rust and set up a Substrate development environment on Apple macOS computers with either Intel or Apple Silicon (M-series) processors.

## Before you begin

Before you install Rust and set up your development environment on macOS, verify that your computer meets the following basic requirements:

- Operating system version is 10.7 Lion, or later.
- Processor speed of at least 2Ghz, 3Ghz recommended.
- Memory of at least 8 GB RAM, 16 GB recommended.
- Storage of 10 GB available.
- Broadband Internet connection.

### Install Homebrew

In most cases, you should use Homebrew to install and manage packages on macOS computers.
If you don't already have Homebrew installed on your local computer, you should download and install it before continuing.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open the Terminal application.

1. Download and install Homebrew by running the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```

1. Verify Homebrew has been successfully installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

   The command displays output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Homebrew 3.3.1
   Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision c6c488fbc0f; last commit 2021-10-30)
   Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 66bab33b26; last commit 2021-10-30)
   ```

## Installation

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides cryptography, such as `openssl`.

To install `openssl` and the Rust toolchain on macOS:

1. Open the Terminal application.

1. Ensure you have an updated version of Homebrew by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew update
   ```

1. Install the `openssl` package by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```
   
1. Install the `protoc` package by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install protobuf
   ```

1. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

1. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

1. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

1. Verify your installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

1. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   rustup default stable
   rustup update
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

1. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` WebAssembly (wasm) targets to your development environment by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   rustup update nightly
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
   ```

1. Verify the configuration of your development environment by running the following command:

   ```bash
   rustup show
   rustup +nightly show
   ```

   The command displays output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   # rustup show

   active toolchain
   ----------------

   stable-x86_64-apple-darwin (default)
   rustc 1.61.0 (fe5b13d68 2022-05-18)

   # rustup +nightly show

   active toolchain
   ----------------

   nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin (overridden by +toolchain on the command line)
   rustc 1.63.0-nightly (e71440575 2022-06-02)
   ```

   1. Install `cmake` using the following command:

   ```
   brew install cmake
   ```

## Compile a Substrate node

Now that you have Rust installed and the Rust toolchains configured for Substrate development, you are ready to finish setting up your development environment by cloning the Substrate **node template** files and compiling a Substrate node.

The node template provides a working environment that includes all of the most common features you need to build a blockchain without any extraneous modules or tools.
To ensure that the node template offers a relatively stable working environment for you to experiment with, the recommended best practice is to clone the Substrate node template from the Substrate Developer Hub repository, rather than from the core Substrate repository.

To compile the Substrate node template:

1. Clone the node template repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
   ```

   In most cases, you can clone the `main` branch to get the latest code.
   However, you can use the `--branch` command-line option if you want to work with a Substrate branch that is compatible with a specific Polkadot version.
   Click [Tags](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tags) to see the list of branches that are compatible with specific Polkadot versions.

1. Change to the root of the node template directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd substrate-node-template
   ```

   If you want to save your changes and make this branch easy to identify, you can create a new branch by running a command similar to the following:

   ```bash
   git switch -c my-wip-branch
   ```

1. Compile the node template by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

   Because of the number of packages required, compiling the node can take several minutes.

After the build is completed successfully, your local computer is ready for Substrate development activity.

## Where to go next

The Substrate Developer Hub acts as a central portal for access to the many resources available to the community.
Depending on your interests and learning style, you might prefer one avenue over another.
For example, if you prefer to read source code and are familiar with Rust, you might want to start by digging into the [Rust API](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master).
