As noted in [Blockchain basics](/fundamentals/blockchain-basics), a blockchain relies on a decentralized network of computers—called nodes—that communicate with each other.

Because the node is a core component of any blockchain, it’s important to understand what makes a Substrate node unique, including the core services and libraries that are provided by default and how the node can be customized and extended to suit different project goals.

## Client and runtime

At a high level, a Substrate node consists of two main parts:

- A **client** with **outer node services** that handles network activity such as peer discovery, managing transaction requests, reaching consensus with peers, and responding to RPC calls.

- A **runtime** that contains all of the business logic for executing the state transition function of the blockchain.

The following diagram illustrates this separation of responsibilities in simplified form to help you visualize the architecture and how Substrate provides a modular framework for building blockchains.

## Client outer node services

The outer node is responsible for activity that takes place outside of the runtime.
For example, the outer node is responsible for handling peer discovery, managing the transaction pool, communicating with other nodes to reach consensus, and answering RPC calls or browser requests from the outside world.

Some of the most important activities that are handled by the outer node involve the following components:

- [Storage](/fundamentals/state-transitions-and-storage/): The outer node persists the evolving state of a Substrate blockchain using a simple and highly efficient key-value storage layer.

- [Peer-to-peer networking](/fundamentals/node-and-network-types/): The outer node uses the Rust implementation of the [`libp2p` network stack](https://libp2p.io/) to communicate with other network participants.

- [Consensus](/fundamentals/consensus/): The outer node communicates with other network participants to ensure they agree on the state of the blockchain.

- [Remote procedure call (RPC) API](/build/remote-procedure-calls/): The outer node accepts inbound HTTP and WebSocket requests to allow blockchain users to interact with the network.

- [Telemetry](/maintain/monitor/): The outer node collects and provides access to node metrics through an embedded [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server.

- [Execution environment](/build/build-process/): The outer node is responsible for selecting the execution environment—WebAssembly or native Rust—for the runtime to use then dispatching calls to the runtime selected.

Substrate provides default implementations for handling these activities through its core blockchain components.
In principle, you can modify or replace the default implementation of any component with your own code.
In practice, it's rare for an application to require changes to any of the underlying blockchain features, but Substrate allows you to make changes so you are free to innovate where you see fit.

Performing these tasks often requires the client node services to communicate with the runtime.
This communication is handled by calling specialized [runtime APIs](/reference/runtime-apis/).

## Runtime

The runtime determines whether transactions are valid or invalid and is responsible for handling changes to the blockchain state.
Requests coming from the outside come through the client into the runtime, and the runtime is responsible for the state transition functions and storing the resulting state.

Because the runtime executes the functions it receives, it controls how transactions are included in blocks and how blocks are returned to the outer node for gossiping or importing to other nodes.
In essence, the runtime is responsible for handling everything that happens on-chain.
It is also the core component of the node for building Substrate blockchains.

The Substrate runtime is designed to compile to [WebAssembly (Wasm)](/reference/glossary#webassembly-wasm) byte code.
This design decision enables:

- Support for forkless upgrades.
- Multi-platform compatibility.
- Runtime validity checking.
- Validation proofs for relay chain consensus mechanisms.

Similar to how the outer node has a way to provide information to the runtime, the runtime uses specialized [host functions](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_io/index.html) to communicate with the outer node or the outside world.

## Light client nodes

A light client or light node is a simplified version of a Substrate node that only provides the runtime and current state.
Light nodes enable users to connect to a Substrate runtime directly using a browser, browser extension, mobile device, or desktop computer.
With a light client node, you can use RPC endpoints written in Rust, JavaScript, or other languages to connect to the WebAssembly execution environment to read block headers, submit transactions, and view the results of transactions.
