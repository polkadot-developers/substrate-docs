DO NOT delete or rename this readme file and follow the instructions bellow:

1. This is a Markdown template you can copy and rename to add a new banner (eg.: "campaign-name.md").

2. Allowed markup is only plain text, **strong** and [link](https://example.com).

3. Paragraphs can be used instead of new lines.

4. Keep in mind to be short as possible (max 160 characters) as the Banner UI could get quite big.

5. One banner is optimal but the UI supports two if really needed. In such a case they will be stacked in the Banner UI in an alphabetical order.

6. You can archive banners by setting "active: false" to exclude it from the Banner UI.
