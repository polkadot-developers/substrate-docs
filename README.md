### Working with `/docs` content

#### URL paths

All `.md` files added to `./content/md/en/docs/` folder will output an URL path without the `/docs` prefix, eg.:

- `index.md` for a category page : `./content/md/en/docs/reference/index.md` &rarr; `/reference/`
- `<article-name>.md` for an article in its parent category `./content/md/en/docs/reference/glossary.md` &rarr; `/reference/glossary/`

You can use any structure nesting needed, there is no limit of depth.

#### Media / Images

- use `./content/media/images/docs/` folder for images to be included in `/docs/*/*.md` files
- source images in `.md`: `/media/images/docs/path/to/your/image/<image>.ext`

#### Navigation config

- update `./content/config/nav.yaml` to add or amend items and linking to your content
  - an exception being `./content/md/en/docs/reference/how-to-guides/...` files that should _only_ be listed on the main how-to guide page in the index page for these pages: `./content/md/en/docs/reference/how-to-guides/index.md`, not to be included in the side bar.

This config file is used to generate sidebar menu where:

- menu is populated from the `menu` sequence (respecting order)
- menu supports three level hierarchy
- menu accepts external links, eg.: `https://substrate.io`

## Local Development

### Install

Navigate into your cloned local repo directory and install all dependencies.

```shell
# https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm is suggested, so that you
# switch to the correct version of node set in the .nvmrc file
nvm i

# Install dependancies
yarn
```

**gatsby-plugin-substrate submodule**

This website uses a submodule for shared components. To set it up please refer to the [gatsby-plugin-substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/gatsby-plugin-substrate#troubleshooting).

**Configure environment variables**

Copy `example.env.development` into a new `.env.development` file.

Config URL variables based on your preferable local setup.
URL will be used for links generation between Substrate websites.

Default localhost port configuration:

```env
GATSBY_WEBSITE_URL=http://localhost:8100
GATSBY_DOCS_URL=http://localhost:8200
GATSBY_MARKETPLACE_URL=http://localhost:8300
GATSBY_CAREERS_URL=https://careers.substrate.io
```

**Start development server**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and use the following command to start the development server locally.

```shell
yarn develop
```

**Troubleshooting**

It is sometimes the case that gastby's cache gets corrupted when making changes.
If you run into issues in local development, try to clean this and restart:

```shell
yarn clean
yarn develop
```
